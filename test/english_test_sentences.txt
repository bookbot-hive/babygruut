It is Emma's birthday.
It is time to get her gifts. What is this one?
She grabs the string and pulls it.
It's a bike! Now she can drive around town.
Emma can't wait to hop on and drive.
Her mum and dad tell her that there are more gifts first.
One of the boxes is full of stuff to stick on the bike and make it look cute.
She sticks them on. She smiles.
Her mum and dad got her a new, pink helmet.
If she crashes, the helmet will keep her head safe.

She gets a feel for the bike on the path.
Then she tests it on a road with no cars.
She can drive with the cars now.

Emma wishes that she could drive all of the time, but she will have to wait until the sun is up again.
Sleep well, Emma!
The yard must get a clip and trim.
We put on hats for the sun.
We get long shirts and pants.
Clip and trim. Mum has the mower.
It is a machine that cuts grass.
The mower hits a rock. We must stop and find it.
I spot it.
I grab it and toss it in the trash chute.
Hiss! Dad spots a snake. Mum and I come to see.
The snake is cute.
It will move on if we let it be.
I pop up some plants and find ants.
They are mad at me.
Clip and trim. We are in the yard for a long time.
Then it is pizza time! Dad is the best pizza chef.
This is Forester.
He makes sure that the forest is safe for all animals, big and small.

He is glad to see that they are well.
He plucks up clues from shrubs and trees.
He can tell if the birds are well from these clues.
Hiss! Forester likes all of the animals.
He checks on the snakes. They seem well too.
A web can tell Forester if the bugs are well.
They drop a line and spin it.
The kangaroos. This does not seem fine.
Where is the joey?
Forester sees it. It got stuck in a trap.
He frees it.
He is glad that the joey is free, but he feels the need to find who set the trap.
He finds the man and calls the cops.
He can see what it feels like to not be free.

Nakita cares for elephants.
If there are elephants that get hurt out in the wild, Nakita helps them.
People call her if they find elephants that are in need.
One of these elephants has a sprain in its trunk.
One does not want to eat. One has a headcold.
She works with a vet to find out what they need.
Then her work starts.
The best part of the job is when an elephant is back in good health.
Then Nakita takes it back to where it was found.
She makes sure that it gets to its family.
Nakita finds a young elephant in a ditch.
It has hurt its leg. It can't get out by itself.

She gains the elephant's trust.
She puts a hand on his trunk.
He can tell that she will not hurt him.
They get the elephant out of the ditch.
He can walk on his leg a bit.
They lead him to a truck so that they can take him to the vet and check out his leg.

Still, it is good that Nakita found him.
His leg will heal a lot quicker in their care.
The elephant will be fine in a day or so.
Nakita helps the elephant to rest.
She brings it all that it needs.

This sloth wants a nap.
It will find a prime spot.
Is this the spot to curl up and have a rest?
Munch! This is not the spot. Move on, sloth.
Up to the next branch. Is this the spot for a nap?
Ah, yes.
Oh no! A bunch of bees in a hive!
This is not the spot.
Is this branch the spot that it wants?
Crunch! That is not a branch. Let that snake go!
It is close to the top. This must be the spot.
Oh no! Come on, sloth. Up to the top.
I hope there is one more spot.
The sloth is at the top. Is this the spot?
Yes. Have a good nap, sloth.
Kim and Chris get home from school. A big mess!
Mess makes my head ache. Fix up the bed.

Get rid of the dust.
Kim and Chris step to the chords of a tune.
Puff! There is some dust by the chair.
Put the cups in. It fits a lot.
Get the last of it.
Brush the cat. Fold and scrub.
It was not that hard to get it done.
Time to have fun!
This is Nip and her mum.
They live just down from a sea town.
They go on a walk to town. Nip likes the shells.
There are a lot of crabs in town.
Nip waves at one. Wow! He has a big claw!
There are a lot of crabs that look the same as them.
There is a round, pale crab.
He is quite big, but he is kind.
The crab with the big claw is pals with the round, pale crab.
Wow! There are a lot of crabs in town.
Nip and her mum go by the big rock to get to the sea.
The sea! Nip runs. She does not look.
She bumps into a small crab with big eyes.
He gets mad.
An old crab comes to sort him out.
The crab is sorry. He has had a long day.
He tells Nip and her mum a good spot to sit by the sea.
Nip and her mum sit by the sea til the waves come in.
Now it is time to go home.
Nip had the best time in town.
Anika wants to go in the sea, but she is scared.
Her mum tells her to give it a try.
She jumps in and then needs to stand back up.
The sea went in the spout. She spits it out.
She can see a lot of shells.
She counts them as she gets the hang of the spout.
Anika spots a turtle!
It went from the beach to the sea, just like Anika did!
She sees a fish that can fly! She swims with it.
It jumps up. Splash!
She dives deep in the sea.
She swims by a big, gold rock.
It is not a rock!
Its legs come out and it jets off.
It is an octopus!
The octopus can turn red. What will it do next?
It turns blue! Then... ouch!
The octopus nips Anika with its beak.
She sinks to the bed of sand.
What lives in this reef?
A long eel! It darts out.
Anika backs off so that the eel can flee.
It just wants to be safe.
As she starts to go back, she sees a manta ray.
She peers at it. It seems like it can fly.
The last thing that she sees is dolphins.
They help take her back to her mum.
Her mum asks what it was like. Anika tells all.
She is a big fan of the deep.
He is by the park.
A fish and chip shop.
Yum.
He must talk to the man.
Hi!
He gets a fish bun.
He gets chips.
Hand him the cash.
It is so fab.
He had it all.
Pop it in the bin.
Back to the park.
Meet Archie.
He likes to think of things that he can test and try.
At his desk and in his bed, Archie thinks of things to make.
Archie makes bots that can fix him a snack.
They peel, mix and cut.
He has been at work on a pen that can make art with no help!
He must be fit and eat well so that he can keep up with work.
We need him to make things that can help us.
And to make things that are just for fun.
What will Archie make next?
Book ONE The Machine.
The children went up the old, rotting stairs.
Ada was at the front. She looked to the side.
There was the bed of roses.
Well, a bed of stems now.
The roses had all lost their heads.
She didn't know why their little prank had seemed so funny at the time.
Now they had to come by in the afternoons to help the old lady with odd jobs around the house until their debt was paid.
Ada was in a foul mood.
She didn't think that they should have to receive such a harsh punishment.
Her parents had said that they were the old lady's prize roses, but nothing seemed prized about this place.
The lawn was all patchy and full of weeds.
You couldn't take a step without your foot landing on some sort of trash or old graffiti.
Ada tapped on the door and paint chips flaked off, spinning as they fell.
Darren, Lachlan and his little sister Skink stood behind her looking squeamish.
The old lady opened the door.
She wasn't like any other old lady that the kids had ever seen.
Old ladies were clean and had neat hair and wore everything just so.
This woman had a wide smile that almost let her false teeth escape from their prison.
There was a huge mole on her cheek with hairs that sprang out like the weeds in her garden.
On one eye she wore a monocle, with that part of her face looking zoomed in by comparison.
And all over her crazy hair and itchy looking skin the kids could see dust and grime and little bugs jumping off like they were leaving a sinking ship.
Hello, dears, she said. I am Mrs. Quigley.
Then she walked in and the four of them followed.
I have tea and rock cakes all ready, Mrs.
Quigley said. The kids hadn't expected that.
They had gotten such a scolding from their parents and were sure that they would be walking into more of the same.
The four of them walked over and sat on the lumpy couch.
There was stuff all over the place.
There were notes and pictures scattered about.
Ada thought it was gross.
Darren was just glad he wasn't getting yelled at.
Skink was looking forward to rock cakes and tea.
But when Lachlan looked around at the walls and ceiling, he felt sorry for the old lady.
The tea was lukewarm and the rock cakes too hard, but the children suffered them with a smile.
At least she wasn't cranky, Ada thought.
Maybe she was just lonely and wanted some company and a bit of help around the house.
That wouldn't be so bad.
Well, now that you are settled in, we must get to the matter of your punishment, Mrs.
Quigley said with a grin.
Ada felt the others squirming on the couch beside her and heard a distinctive plop as Skink lost her rock cake in her tea.
Tell me, do you like reading? Mrs. Quigley asked.
Ada was so taken aback by the question that she didnt know quite how to respond.
Darren spoke up instead. We don't like it much.
Books are always so boring.
None of us read any more than we have to for school.
Yeah, chimed in Skink.
Why can't there be any books that are just for fun?
Mrs. Quigley gave a bit of an impish smile.
Well, it wasn't always like that.
The older three grew uncomfortable.
They had heard about other books.
Books that got destroyed long ago.
Books that weren't good for people to read, particularly children.
But that had been generations ago. Could Mrs.
Quigley have read one at some point in her life?
Now when they looked at her she didn't just seem like she was a poor, old lady.
Now she seemed full of deceit.
And you're in luck.
I happen to still have a few old books that you might find a little more interesting than the ones that you have at school.
I would love for you to read them to me.
I'm too old now to get through them myself.
Lachlan frowned.
What are they about?
They're works of fiction, Mrs. Quigley explained.
Weren't all of them destroyed before you were even born?
Darren asked. Most of them, Mrs Quigley replied.
But my husband managed to find me a few through his life.
He said that my mind worked in different ways to other people, and that he wanted to help me to grow those thoughts.
He even made me a machine so that I could read the books properly.
That is what you will use when you read for me.
We can read, Ada said.
I'm sure that you can read non fiction very well.
But reading fiction needs a whole set of different skills.
Skills that haven't been taught to children for so long that teachers wouldn't even know how.
Can we talk about it first? Ada asked.
Of course, Mrs. Quigley said.
Then she left the room.
I don't know about this, Darren said.
Those books were destroyed for a reason.
It changed the way that people thought.
I mean I'm curious, but I just don't know.
Ada considered this.
Darren was good at perceiving things from all sides.
What do you think, Lachlan? she asked.
It's not like we have ever stopped doing something because we weren't meant to before?
he said with a smirk.
Ada and Lachlan had a knack for getting the four of them in trouble.
Skink? Ada asked.
They all stayed quiet while Skink thought.
It could be fun... And they are just books.
How bad could they be? Ada nodded. Ok then.
We'll give it a go.
And if it is too crazy, we can just leave at the end of today and not come back.
The children walked down into the basement.
It smelled old and musty like a tomb.
There were boxes of old receipts and newspapers everywhere.
Mrs. Quigley took them over to a chest.
It was old and shabby like everything else in the house, but something felt different.
There were subtle carvings of different animals all over it, running around the chest.
Mrs.
Quigley held it close to her for a moment, then placed it on a table in front of the kids.
She produced a chunky, rusted key from her pocket and held it out.
Ada took it.
She put the key in the lock and began to turn it.
It clicked, then she opened the lid of the chest.
There were ten books inside.
Aside from the fact that they were old, they didn't look any more dangerous than their maths or science books.
Each one had a little symbol on the side.
Pick any one you like, Mrs. Quigley said.
Ada reached out for one with a bird symbol on the spine.
Before we begin, you will need to think of a character for yourself.
Ada, Darren, and Lachlan tried, but they couldn’t think of anybody else to be.
It seemed conceited to think that they could be somebody better or more interesting than what they were.
They chose themselves.
Skink, however, decided about ten different animals that she wanted to be before Mrs.
Quigley put forward the idea of her being a shapeshifter.
That way, she could be whatever she wanted when the time came.
Skink thought that was perfect.
Then Mrs. Quigley took them over to the machine.
They stood still as Mrs.
Quigley put strange caps on their heads with tubes that lead to a tank.
There were all kinds of switches and wires.
This wasn't the kind of machine that they had imagined at all.
Mrs.
Quigley took the book that Ada had chosen and placed it in the tank.
The book began to come to pieces and float down the tubes, into their caps.
And then everything went black.
This is Callum. It is his job to drive cars.
He likes to zoom on the track.
He wins a lot.
This is when he stood up to get first prize!
He keeps his cars in good shape.
He wants to make a car that can zoom on the track.
Callum gets all of the parts to make the car.
The last thing is a bolt on the side.
It looks good.
The car is good to go. He zooms on the loop.
Callum wins!
His mum and dad are there to see it all.
Ella stops for a breath and reads her map.
She is lost.
She gets to a lake.
She has to cross, but there is no path.
She walks on by.
Ella comes to a head with some bugs.
They are mad that she is by their nest.
Next she finds birds. They flap in the wind.
Ella takes that path.
There is a stag. The stag is not a threat.
Prints in the grass. Ella fills with dread.
Can what made the prints hurt her?
It is a unicorn!
Ella has read so much on unicorns.
It will not hurt her.
The unicorn lets her hop up on it.
Its breath smells sweet.
The unicorn takes Ella to a spot where the plants are spread thin.
She can get home from there.
It is the sixth of the tenth.
Time for gifts, Emma!
The gift is a bike!
Emma puts stuff on the bike to make it cute.
She must be safe on the bike.
Emma gets on her bike. She rolls by.
Emma drives her bike to the park.
She drives to all of the spots she likes best.
Time for bed.
Emma will get up and ride with the sun.
This is Archie. He likes to make new things.
Some of the things that he makes are to help us.
Some things he makes just for fun.
Archie finds it hard to just switch off.
He thinks all day of things that he can test and try.
Archie does not like to cook.
He made bots to cook breakfast for him.
They make meals too!
He likes to make things that can think on their own.
Here is a pen that can make its own art!
Archie tells it to draw something with dolphins.
It puts the dolphins in space!
He makes sure that he takes breaks.
Archie eats well and keeps fit.
He needs to care for his mind so that he can work hard.
His laptop is just there to jot down thoughts if they come.
When things go bad in the town, Archie comes up with ways to fix them.
Here is a van than can help us at sea.
He makes things just for fun, too.
Here are some of his big hits: a smart fridge, a backpack that walks and a bot that serves ice cream.
What will Archie work on next? Something to help?
Something fun?
There is no end to what we can do if we have the will.
This is Callum. He races cars for a living.
He goes to races all around the world to compete.
He often places well.
He collects cars.
Some are for racing and some are just for fun.
He opens them up and changes their parts to make them super fast.
Callum often wins prizes.
When he is on the stand, the crowd cheers.
They take his picture for websites.
Callum takes very good care of his cars.
Machines need a lot of care.
He makes sure to keep them clean and drive them often.
Right now he is working on plans for a new car.
He will make this one from scratch.
It will be his best car yet!
The hood is open. The engine is ready to go in.
Callum works on each part so that it is perfect.
This car has to be the best on the track.
He paints it all black with a yellow lightning bolt on the side.
He gives names to all of his cars.
This one is The Storm'.
Callum is in The Storm. They are on the track.
They are miles ahead of the other cars and their drivers.
Go Callum, go!
Callum wins in The Storm!
His parents are there to see it.
They go to each one of his races and sit in the crowd.
They are so proud.
Spencer likes sports. He hikes and swims.

A big wave broke homes.
Spencer helps them and their pets.
Spencer helps kids that have to live in tents for a bit.

That was hard work! Spencer gets a prize.
Spencer likes sports. He likes to be on the move.
As a man, Spencer gets into the army.
He has to show that he is fit.
A big wave broke homes.
Spencer helps them go back when the sea is low.
Kids that have no home for a bit.
Spencer hands them things to call their own.
They are stuck.
It will be slow work to get them up, but Spencer and his pals can do it!
If there is a big fire, a lot of people need food and clothes.
A big storm can blow homes to bits.
Spencer is there to help clean.
Spencer loves his job. His kids are proud.
The yard is wild. It must get a clip and trim.
We dress for yard work.
Mum trims the grass. Dad clips the tall plants.
A rock zips by. It did not hit us.
I find it. I put it in a bed by the plants.
Hiss! A snake is in the mix!
We let it be. It will not hurt us.
Pop! I pull up a plant. The ants get mad.
Work in the yard helps us be fit.
At the end, we can eat. Yum!
Their mum and dad have told them to clean the house when they get home from school.
Oh no! It is such a mess!
They have not kept up with their chores.
Their rooms are a mess. The beds are not made.
There is a lot of stuff on the floor.
This will take some time.
Mum and Dad told them to do the dishes last night.
They did not.
Now, they have to do that on top of the rest of their chores.
They pick up the things on the floor.
Then they get the brooms.
They give the whole room a good sweep.
He crouches down to get the dust out from under the couch.
Couches can have a lot of dirt under them.
She does the dishes then puts them back in the cupboard.
The cups go in one part of the cupboard.
The plates and bowls have spots as well.
Not too much left to go now. One more sweep.
Then they put the last touches on the house to make it look great.
She brushes the cat so that it will not leave fur on the beds.
He folds the quilts and scrubs the loo.
Their rooms are all clean now.
He puts his slippers by the bed.
She feeds the fish.
Now that they are done with their chores, they can have fun!
It was good to get in and do all of their jobs first.
It is midsummer. We have had a lot of rain.
The plants in the garden have grown far too tall.
We need to have a day in the yard.
I like yard days.
It is a fun way to spend time with my mum and dad.
We get in our garden clothes.
We have hats to protect us from the sun.
Our long shirts and pants do that too, but they also protect our skin from scratches and bites that we might get in the yard.
The boots keep our feet safe and sound.
Mum starts up the mower. It clips the grass.
She likes to make lines in the grass so that the lawn looks like art.
Dad is going to trim the shrubs. They are too big.
They will grow well after they get a trim.
The mower hits a rock.
Lucky we had our boots and long pants on.
I see the rock while it is in mid air.
The rock flies past Mum.
She stops the mower and we all look for the rock.
I think about where I saw the rock and which way it was going.
I spot it. We are lucky it did not hurt any of us.
I toss it in a garden bed so that it is out of the way.
Hiss! Dad spots a snake. It is a green tree snake.
It will not bite if it is left alone.
They have no fangs and no venom. It is no threat.
Seeing garden critters is one of the best parts about being out in the yard.
We step back and take a picture.
Then we leave it in the tree and get on with other jobs.
We have a break at midday so that we are not in the harsh sun.
Then we start up again.
I start to pluck the weeds.
One of them is hard to pull up.
When it pops out, there are a lot of ants in the soil around the hole.
They are mad. Was their nest under the weed?
We are more than midway through our jobs in the yard.
I like to work in the garden because you can see what you have done.
It feels good to step back and see what you have done in a day.
At the end, we order some pizza.
We have had a big day. Time for a treat!
Yard days are the best.
Ren will take a trip to Mars.
He spots the Sun.
Ren drives for the last part. It is hard to land.
He must hike up a dune to get the best sand.
It is hard, but Ren can cope.
He puts the Mars sand in a bag to take back.
He stops to say hi to a bot.
We put the bot on Mars.
Ren rides back. He will test the sand from Mars.
The sand from Mars will tell us so much.
Ren is off on a great trip to Mars!
He will be the first to go there.
It takes a while to get to Mars.
When Ren wants a break, the ship can drive.
Ren lands in a spot on Mars where he can get some great rocks to bring home with him.
He steps on the sand.
It is a great thing for all of Earth to have him on Mars.
Ren walks out to the spot where he can get the best rocks.
It is hard work.
He takes breaks so that he can rest.
When the bag is full, he finds a bot that works on Mars.
He waves. Hi!
Then it is back to Earth.
It looks great from up in the ship!
On Earth, Ren can do tests on the rocks.
What will he find?
Ren is about to board a ship to Mars.
He will be the first on the Red Planet.
We have sent bots there, but Ren will be the first person.
He launches. It takes months to get to Mars.
Most of the time the ship drives itself.
Still, sometimes Ren needs to check if the ship is on track.
He flicks switches and reads screens.
He is in orbit around Mars now.
He has to make sure that the ship touches down at the right angle and speed.
There is a lot of stress on Earth when things land on Mars.
Ren touches down! The ship is all well.
He takes his first step on Mars.
He has a space suit so that he can breathe.
Air is not the same on Mars as it is on Earth.
Wow, the first prints on Mars!
Ren starts to walk to the site where he will start the dig.
It is close to the ship.
He did not land the ship too close so that he would not affect the site.
Ren digs up soil and rocks.
He stores them in his bag.
He makes sure that he gets a few kinds to test.
The rocks and soil will help us learn about how Mars was made.
He checks in on one of the bots on Mars.
The bot has a camera.
He waves to the people on Earth.
The bot sends files back for us to watch them.
Ren takes his rocks and soil back to the ship and is back off into space again.
When he reaches the end of his trip, Earth looks like a blue ball.
Ren is back with his rocks and soil.
What will they tell us about the Red Planet?
We will test them and learn things for years to come.

There was a landslide. These people got stuck.
Their house came down on top of them.

It helps me to lock in the good times.
It gives me something to look back on.
This is a painting of when my mum, my dad and I went on a train trip.
We were on the train for two weeks.
We had our own cabin.
The train went by so many great places.

I saw people sail their boats in the water.

That way, I get to see things that I never could in our world.
Here is a boat. The boat is in a bay.
It is all normal so far. Nothing crazy here.
I like doing paintings like this, where most things are normal aside from one part.
Like this goat!
A goat in a coat is rowing the boat.
I paint him with hands. He also has a scarf on.
It would be quite cold out there on the water at night.
I wonder what this goat is doing.
Is he off to visit a friend? Is he going home?
Maybe he is just out to enjoy the moon on this lovely night.

Ella is on a quest in a forest.
She found a map that shows where a great grail lays.
She is near where the X marks the spot on the map.
That is as far as the map can take her.
Ella comes to a lake.
There are plants floating in it.
Are these what she is looking for?
They are stunning. They glow.
Ella walks by the glowing plants and keeps looking around.
She comes across some glowing bugs.
What is giving them their power?
It feels like she is on the path to something big.
The grail must be close.
Next she finds large, pink birds.
As they fly, they make a breeze.
It is like Ella is getting drawn to a spot in the forest by the plants and the animals that live in it.
She is on the other side of the lake now.
She finds a stag and some rabbits.
She is watching them from the bushes so that she does not scare them.
They look like normal stags and rabbits.
She turns back the other way.
Ah... footprints.
Of all of the signs that Ella has been using to get to the grail, these feel the closest to the end of her quest.
She starts walking by the tracks.
It's a unicorn!
No wonder that all of the parts of the forest had an odd power to them.
Ella has done a lot of reading about unicorns.
She can't believe that there is one right in front of her!
The unicorn wakes up and walks over to her.
It has no fear of her.
It lets Ella pet its mane and tail.
It lets Ella get up on its back!
Ella spends the rest of the day in the forest with the unicorn.
Each place that they go to, things seem full of that odd power.
Ella can see why the map marked such a grail.

Lisa's mum and dad told her she would get a pet as a gift this year!
Will it be an elephant? No.
An elephant will make a big mess.
Will it be a croc?
No, a croc would be a lot of work.
How about a small, brown porcupine? She hopes not.
They have spines.
Will it be a skunk? No. What a stink!
Will it be a rhino?
No, the rhino would smash the house up.
How about a lion? No. It would be gross to feed.
Will it be a snake?
No, a snake would hug too tight.
Will it be a giraffe? No.
A giraffe would grow too tall.
So what then?
What did Lisa's mum and dad get for her?
They get the gift and show her.
A pup is the best kind of gift.
This is Zom. He is a zombie.
Zombies are meant to eat brains, but Zom is sick of eating brains day after day.
He wants something new to snack on.
He is going to try cooking.
He is off to find new tastes to use in his meals.
Is that an egg? Why is it so green?
Eggs from most chickens are brown or white.
I think that egg might be rotten, Zom.
Best to leave it where it is and find a new egg to use for cooking.
You dont want to.
oh. You are keeping it. That is so gross, Zom!
You are going to have a lot of problems if you use that egg in your cooking and eat it.
You will fart for days.
Your farts will smell like skunk spray.
You really want it? Ok it is your meal I guess.
What are you going to combine with that rotten egg?
Is that wheat?
That wheat looks like it has gone off to me.
Really, I insist. Find some more.
If you eat things that have gone bad you will get sick.
I guess the wheat is coming too.
I suspect that you are going to have the worst poops in the whole world after you eat this meal.
What is it going to be?
A rotten egg and wheat that has gone off.
What's next?
Is that… sugar? But it is all green and grey.
I think it has been left out and grown mould.
I did not know that sugar could even do that.
I am full of disgust, but I bet I can guess what is going to happen next.
Yup. Welcome to the crew, foul sugar.
I guess you are going to get cooked up along with the rotten egg and gross wheat.
I still cannot picture what you are going to make with all of this, Zom.
Is there still more to find?
Of course.
A pail of milk that is so old that it has gone yellow and chunky.
Great. That is going to be a treat.
At this point, I think that I would rather have brains than what you are making.
Grab the pail. Off we go. It is time to cook.
I will hold my nose so that I don’t puke over all of your crafting bench.
Here is the crafting bench.
In go the egg, wheat, sugar and milk.
All of them well past their prime.
What will you get when you combine them?
Let me see... Oh no, Zom. Really?!
A cake?! It stinks!
I cannot get away from the smell.
Are you really going to eat that?
That cannot be better than brains.
I will not hear it.
You love it? Well, as long as you are happy.
I am going to leave now before I puke all over the grass and you use it in your next meal.
Enjoy your cake, Zom.
This is Skel.
He has wanted a pet dog for a long time.
His dog is cute and fun.
He wants to play with him all of the time.
But there is a problem.
Dogs love bones, and Skel is made of them.
How did you not think of that, Skel?
You will have to be careful, or he will start snacking when you are.
too late.
When Skel gets up, his arms are missing.
He can get out of bed, but it hard to do much else.
His dog is not being helpful.
He is not showing Skel where the bones are.
Of course! They have been put by his dog's bowl.
Skel puts some chicken in the bowl and takes his bones back.
I don't think that was a good move, Skel.
You gave him a treat when he did something bad.
Skel thinks it will be fine.
He thinks it is a bit funny and names his dog Bones.
Skel and Bones go out hunting.
Hunting is hard work.
Skel lines up to take a shot, then... clunk!
Skel is missing a leg.
He needs to hop all over the grass to chase Bones and get the leg back.
That is an awful thing for Bones to do, Skel.
You have to train him.
Skel thinks that Bones will grow out of it, but I am not so sure.
Look! Now he has taken your skull, Skel.
This has gone too far.
Now Skel gets it.
He will have to train his dog to not steal his bones, or he will never get things done!
It will take a lot of work, but it will be worth it.
Skel and his dog spend a long time training.
Every time his dog steals a bone, Skel tells him no.
He talks to Bones in a stern tone.
When Bones is good, Skel gives him a treat.
I think Bones gets it now.
He wants to be a good boy.
He does not want to make Skel mad.
Now when Bones looks like he is going to take something, all Skel has to do is say no and he stops.
Skel has trained his dog to play with sticks and not steal bones.
He is very grateful that the problem has been solved.
He can craft sticks for Bones with ease.
Time for the next bit of training, Skel.
One day when Zom was out on a walk, he came across a very strange rabbit.
He had seen rabbits of different colours before, but never a rainbow rabbit.
And if that was not enough, the rainbow rabbit had rainbow milk as well!
Zom likes to create new things.
The rainbow milk gave him a great idea.
First, Zom needed to breed some rainbow rabbits.
He found that not all rabbit eggs ended up giving him rainbow rabbits.
It was total chaos.
He hatched as many eggs as he could and put the rabbits that were not rainbow over the fence and back into the wild.
When he was only left with rainbow rabbits, it was time to get to work.
Zom milked the rabbits.
He put the milk into pails.
He would need a lot of rainbow milk for his idea.
Zom made a cake pop! A rainbow cake pop.
Oh no Zom.
You did not make a cake pop out of the rainbow rabbit milk, did you?
Why have you made a bench by the rabbit pen?
Do you mean to open a shop?
Oh no. Here come the villagers.
Zom has his rainbow cake pops set out on his shop bench.
The villagers cannot wait to buy them.
How will they react?
They have even brought their children with them.
This is going to be a total mess.
I thought it was chaos before.
When the villager next to Zom bites into the cake pop that he has bought, he starts to complain of nausea.
Then he spews.
Rainbow vomit goes all down his front.
Then all of the children start to puke.
As far as the eye can see, there are villagers chucking up rainbows all over the field.
They all start to leave.
There is nobody left to eat the cake pops.
But there is a little black and brown dog.
It seems to be looking right at the rainbow cake pop in Zom's hand.
Zom lets the dog have a try.
He loves it!
The dog does not vomit, he just keeps taking little bits out of the cake pop and eating it all up.
Zom is thrilled.
A skeleton runs over.
He says that his dog got away from him when they were hunting.
He says that his name was Skel.
Zom asks if he wants a rainbow cake pop made with rabbit milk.
Skel says sure! They become fast friends.
One of Zom and Skel's favourite things to do as new buddies is point to the top of a hill and see who can race up there first.
This time there is a pig on the hill.
First to the pig wins!
Skel zooms up the hill and tracks down the pig.
Why was a pig even up this high? Oh well, he won!
He turns around this way, and that to look for Zom, but he is not on his way up the hill.
While he was racing up the hill, Zom has found something.
He has never seen one quite like it, and it gets his mind turning.
He calls out to Skel.
It is a black egg with blue spots and brown around the edge.
Zom wants to eat it right away to see what it tastes like, but Skel says that they should try to find the animal that laid it.
After all, it is an odd egg.
Maybe it is not a very common one?
First, they try a hen.
The hen is walking around looking for bugs in the grass.
It is pouring with rain.
The hen does not look like it cares about the egg one bit.
The hen clucks as it walks away.
Zom thinks that maybe the egg was not from a bird.
A lot of animals that live in the water lay eggs.
They go in the water to see if the salmon or squid look like they want their egg back.
They do not.
Eggs that are laid in the water are soft.
This egg is hard.
Skel has a think. What else comes from eggs?
Dragons! The egg is very strange.
Maybe it is a new kind of dragon that nobody knows about?
If it is, they can take pictures and send them off to websites for cash!
But the dragons in the sky pay no mind to the egg either.
Skel is worried about the egg.
He says that they should bring it back to his place.
He can keep it by his bedside table next to a torch.
That will keep it warm.
The house will also keep the egg safe so that it does not get broken.
One night, Skel tells Zom to visit.
The egg has hatched! It is a spider!
A crazy, neon spider!
They have never seen one like it.
Is it an alien spider from space?
They think that it must be.
The space spider has a giant appetite.
It loves spoiled potatoes most of all.
Poor Bones is not so sure about sharing his bed and food with the spider, but he does not have much of a choice.
Zom loves the space spider.
It is like something from a video game.
He wants to keep it as a pet.
Skel says that it can stay at his house as Zom does not have a home.
It will not do to have the space spider walking out with Zom.
It might get hurt.
Soon, Bones grows used to the spider, and Zom has thought of the perfect name.
Starfang.
Zom sure is glad that Skel did not let him eat the odd egg!
Zom was spending a lot of time at Skel's house.
Between Bones and Starfang, there was not much room for Skel now.
It seemed like one of them was always on his bed.
Skel did not even have enough room to sleep!
Zom made a deal with Skel.
He said that Skel could go on a trip.
He would look after Bones and Starfang and add on to the house for free if he could live with Skel.
Skel said it was a good plan.
Zom started right away.
He wanted to keep the iconic look of Skel's house but make it even better.
He kept the dungeon feel, but changed the floor, walls and ceiling.
He changed the torches to soul torches.
Starfang was grumpy about all the change.
Zom thought that Skel's old room would be just for the pets.
He would make new bedrooms for Skel and himself.
That way there would be room for all.
He gave Bones a treat bone while Skel was away and put up webs for Starfang.
Starfang still did not like it.
He put himself in a corner and hissed.
Zom could only see his eyes in the dark.
Some pets don't trust new things at first.
He promises Starfang that he will not ruin the house.
What a triumph! Zom has finished the entrance.
It is so spooky!
There are ender dragon heads, soul lanterns and jack o lantern blocks.
It is perfect. This house will last for an eon!
Skel is back from his trip. He is so thrilled!
He loves that Zom kept the feel of his house but made it fresh as well.
He can't wait to go inside.
Starfang is there when they open the door.
He is feeling a bit more settled in his new room now.
He greets Skel like Bones does.
What a good little space spider.
Skel is so impressed.
He thinks it is perfect for the pets.
They have a big bed.
Now they will not have to sleep on his bed all of the time.
Bones loves the new place.
He jumps up on the bed for a bone.
Skel tells Zom that he cannot give him them as a treat.
We know why.
Starfang looks calm now.
Zom throws him his favourite food: a spoiled potato!
Starfang munches on it as he sits on the new pet bed.
It all turned out so well. Only that.
Zom, you have not done the rest of the house yet?!
Where are you and Skel going to sleep?
I guess you will have to sleep on the pet bed tonight.
Poor Skel.
Book TWO The Bowerbird Blues.
Everything went black.
The children could hear each other, but they couldn’t see anything.
And then, fine lines started to appear, like somebody was sketching a world before them.
They saw a small town surrounded by a forest.
They saw birds navigating through the sky.
The more details that were drawn in, the more that they felt like they were a part of that world.
Before long, it seemed as real as the basement.
Darren, Lachlan and Skink all looked at Ada.
Well.
let’s head into that town and see what happens, she suggested.
When they got into the town, it seemed much like other small towns that they had been to on road trips with their families.
As they walked down the main street, a policeman was walking up the other way.
He gave a cough and headed over to them.
He seemed so real.
Ada started to wonder what they could have possibly done already.
He approached.
You lot are new around here. Yeah, Ada said.
Darren gave her a jab in the side.
Yes, Sir, Ada corrected.
The policeman frowned but seemed happy to look past it.
I won’t be harsh on you then, the policeman said, seeing that you might not have known.
Might not have known what? asked Darren.
It was then that Darren noticed the policeman paying particular attention to certain items that they had brought with them.
You’re going to need to give over a few things, or I’ll have to report you, the policeman said.
He pointed out Lachlan’s shirt, Darren’s laces, and a bracelet on Skink’s arm.
All of them were blue.
The policeman gave Lachlan a white shirt and Darren black laces when they surrendered the items, but he didn’t have a new bracelet for Skink.
I don’t understand what we’ve done, Ada said.
Blue’s bad news in this place, the policeman replied.
We've had enough.
It's gotten to a point where we simply can’t allow it.
The policeman left with their things.
Ada saw a lady watching them.
She walked over to her. What was that all about?
Darren sighed.
Ada wasn't exactly the politest of their little group.
The lady had a far away look.
You put us in danger, she said.
What do you mean? Lachlan asked.
The blue calls to them.
The ones that bring the sadness. Look!
He took them off you just in time.
There's one of them now!
the lady said, pointing to a bird before running off.
The children looked at each other.
Well, I guess we have to find out what that was all about, Darren said, frowning.
I might have the answer, Skink said, producing a small, blue hair tie from her pocket.
Good job, Ada said with a wink.
They walked just outside of the town and put the hair tie on the ground.
Then, they hid in the bushes.
Before long, a bowerbird came.
I know about these, Darren said.
They take blue things to decorate their nests.
But I have never heard about them bringing sadness before?
Skink, Ada said, you know what to do.
Skink focused on the bowerbird and started to transform.
She took to the sky and followed the bird who had taken her hair tie.
Once she had found it, she looped back and led the rest of them to the nest.
At first, they thought Skink had made a mistake and taken them to the dump.
When they looked closer though, they saw that items had been used to make nests.
Lachlan pulled a few things out of the tangled nest.
He found old pictures, a broken toy sword, and a small statue.
All of it had blue paint in sections.
Sometimes they were small dabs.
Sometimes the item was evenly coated all over.
What do you think all of this is?
Ada asked the others.
What was that the lady said about something being called and bringing sadness?
Maybe they have lost people, Darren said.
Maybe they wanted to make the memories go away.
But somewhere along the way, as they started leaving things out for the birds to take, they started blaming them for the way that they feel.
That makes sense, Ada said.
Maybe we can show people that they don't have to be scared of the birds and their nests.
Skink was looking at the things in the nest, keeping quiet.
She fluttered up to Lachlan’s shoulder.
I think I might have an idea, Lachlan said.
When our grandad died, some things that dad was doing didn't make sense.
He would get really angry if anybody spoke about Grandad and put all of Grandad's things in the shed.
He picked up one of the toys that had been roughly painted blue.
But every now and then he still goes into the shed and looks through them.
I think it helps.
They went back to town and got a group of people to follow them through the forest to the nests.
When people saw their things decorating the nests, they began to smile.
A lot of time had passed.
It was like the things could be beautiful to them again.
Like a drought had broken and they could feel again.
The memories that they held were not so sad anymore.
A young man came to collect the sword.
An old lady took the picture out of its frame and held it close.
And as they watched the treasures being taken home, the four children saw the world break up into lines and have less and less detail until it went dark.
Book Three The Min Min Lights.
The next afternoon, the children went straight to Mrs.
Quigley's house after school.
They waited until they were back in her basement before they started raving about the book.
Mrs.
Quigley smiled as she listened to the twists and turns that the story took.
When they told her how they'd solved the problem, she closed her eyes for a moment and gave a contented sigh.
I thought so, she said.
But it is certainly nice to hear it. Hear what?
Darren asked.
That even without formal training, interacting with stories is somehow a part of each and every one of us.
Does that mean that you’re ready for your next adventure?
she asked.
They sat down on the couch eagerly and waited to be hooked up to the machine.
The book that she chose was black this time, with a yellow circle on the middle of the cover.
First the dark came, then the lines, then a small town of shabby houses and shops that hadn’t been fixed in years.
It made them feel uneasy.
They hadn't ever seen an area that was so broken down.
Skink looked around.
It made her sad to see signs that this was a place that had been loved once.
The faded paint jobs that had been carefully done.
The window boxes full of dead plants.
It was late afternoon, but everybody was already shut up in their houses.
People looked out of their windows at them, wide eyed.
Nobody came out, even when they knocked on their doors.
Then, a gaunt looking man came out of his house and stood at the fence.
The children walked over.
You shouldn’t be walking around like this, the man warned.
Haven’t your parents told you how dangerous is it?
Ada looked at the setting sun.
She knew that it was dangerous to walk around at night, but she’s never been warned about the afternoon.
The man took their blank faces for an answer.
Well, you ought to get inside and stay there until the morning.
Ada felt like he was trying to calm himself down so that his tone wasn't so sharp with them.
Why? she asked simply. It’s not safe at night.
That’s when the min min lights come.
Darren’s ears pricked up. I know about those.
It's an old myth.
Don’t people follow them into the bush?
The man nodded.
You're right about them going off into the bush, but it isn't any myth.
My little girl took an excursion off into the woods and never came back.
It's too late for her, but it isn’t too late for you.
The man got up and went back into his house.
Skink winced as she turned around to look at the others.
Youre not planning on she started.
Oh yeah, Ada said with a grin.
How else are we going to be able to figure out what happened?
Imagine if we had never gone looking for the bowerbird nest in the last book.
The whole town would have stayed sad forever.
Maybe we can help this place too? Skink nodded.
She wasn't sure that helping was the reason behind Ada wanting to follow the min mins, but it made her feel better about the danger.
They walked away from the town and waited for dark.
Just as the man had said, orbs of light started to appear in their vision.
They followed them deeper and deeper into the bush.
Soon they lost track of where the town was.
Then started to hear strange sounds around them.
So.
I've been thinking, Darren said to the group They kept following the lights but turned a little towards Darren.
What happens if we can't read the book?
I mean, if we make mistakes.
And we don't solve the problems? Darren said.
The four of them kept walking on in silence as they thought.
Anybody?
Darren asked, starting to fidget with the hem on his shirt.
Well, we don't know. Do we? Ada said flatly. Ok.
so we don't know if we get stuck in here forever.
We don't know if we die.
We don't know if she's done this to other kids before, because we have only met her twice.
Lachlan frowned over at Darren as he tilted his head in Skink's direction.
What? Darren said. We don't?
The lights changed in size and brightness.
They appeared and disappeared.
The next moment, they appeared right by them and slowly floated over until they were almost close enough for the children to touch.
There were also glowing mushrooms all through the forest that created the illusion of more min mins.
They sometimes followed the light from the mushrooms and got all turned around until they found the lights again.
Sometimes the min mins went away all together.
That was the worst part when they were in the dark bush alone.
Each time the min mins came back, it made them feel safe.
Like somebody was there with them.
Ada had a fantastic sense of direction, but she was less and less sure that she would be able to get them back to the town if she had to.
Finally, one of the min mins was close enough that Ada could touch it.
It wasn't zipping away like the rest did.
Ada knitted her brow and reached out.
The moment that she touched the min min light, she disappeared.
Skinks stomach was in a knot, but she held onto Lachlans hand as he and Darren touched the lights as well.
When they opened their eyes, Ada was there again, but they seemed to be in the same place that they'd started.
The children found their way back to town, but it seemed like it was a slightly different version of what they had been the day before.
By then, it was morning.
They saw people coming out of the sad little houses to start their day.
Only, they weren’t the people that had been peeking through the windows the day before.
They looked similar in some ways, but it certainly wasn't them.
Could it be the lost family members?
Darren asked.
There was only one way to know for sure.
They walked to the house of the man they had spoken to the day before.
When they knocked, the knob turned and there was a young woman who was only a few years older than them.
She looked tired. I'm sorry, do I know you?
she asked in confusion.
We know your father, Ada said softly.
The young woman started to cry.
Just then, a man in a uniform came up behind them.
Did you four just come from the forest?
They nodded.
We will have to find you a place to stay.
Did you have a place in the old town?
Or did you lose your way on a trip? We... ah.
were on a trip, Ada said.
But why don't you go back to the old town?
There are people there that must be missing you terribly.
The man in the uniform sighed.
We've tried, but we kept losing people.
Who's to say if they made it back?
Now it's been so long since we came through.
We can't remember the way.
We haven't had anybody new come through for years.
Ada didn't think anybody would have made it back, or the man who lost his daughter would have had more hope.
I think I could lead us back, she said.
And if we all go together, at least you would end up in the same place and start a new life there.
The man in the uniform and the young lady spoke it over.
They didn't have much to lose in leaving this town.
It was full of so many bad memories.
They decided to go and talk to everybody else in the town and see what they thought.
There was some division in what people wanted to do.
They were all so frightened.
But eventually, they decided that they would stick together and brave the min mins once again.
So that they wouldn't start to follow the mushrooms, Skink turned into a luminous insect and glowed a bright blue.
As Ada followed the min mins, Skink flew after her.
She guided them past the min mins and the mushrooms, keeping them on the right path.
When they got back to the first town that they were in, people started coming out of their houses and pointing towards the forest.
Family members and friends that hadn't seen each other in years tried to find the right words to say as they laughed and cried and hugged.
Their long, exhausted faces started looking bright once again.
Suddenly the whole town seemed to have more life, even though there was still a lot of work to be done on it.
As the world started to break up into lines and fade into darkness, Ada was bursting with pride.
But she also had a bone to pick with Mrs. Quigley.
Ever since Darren had brought up the idea of what would happen to them if they couldn't finish a book, Ada couldn't shake dark thoughts.
She was going to demand the truth.
This is a flamingo. It has massive legs.
Its legs let it wade in the water and scoop up plants, bugs and fish in its large bill.
The bill acts like a spade.
Flamingos have webbed feet like ducks.
Other birds that live near the water, like geese and swans, also have webbed feet.
This is a kingfisher.
They eat fish, but they also eat frogs, bugs and small animals in shells.
They throw up the parts of the animal that they cannot eat, like bones and shells.
They throw it up in a pellet.
A lot of birds do this.
This is a barn owl.
A barn owl hunts at night and sleeps all day.
They are found almost all over the world.
Barn owls can fly without making noise.
It has great sight and hearing.
They dive to grab prey with their talons and then soar back up.
This is a brolga. It is doing a dance.
A lot of birds dance and show their feathers when they they are trying to seek a mate.
It shows that they are healthy, strong and smart.
Will this bird get a mate, or will they be evasive?
This is a great hornbill.
They have such wild beaks!
Their tongues are small, so they need to toss their food down their throat with a jerk of their heads.
The part on the top of the beak is a casque.
It is hollow and helps to make the hornbill's call loud so that it can go far.
This is a rooster.
You might not think that a rooster is impressive, but they are cool birds too!
The large, red part on a rooster's head is a comb.
A rooster is good at keeping their flock safe from snakes and other threats.
Talk about vultures can be emotive.
Some find it sad that vultures prey on the weak.
But this is part of how the world works.
Vultures clean up the bodies.
They keep ecosystems in good health.
Here is a very fancy bird.
Peacocks are known for their bright colours and patterns.
The marks on the tail feathers are eyespots.
This is a male. Peahens are much duller in colour.
Together, the males and females are called peafowl.
This is a sparrow.
Its beak changes colour through the year.
It has a yellow brown colour in the winter and turns black in the warmer months.
This is a male as it has a reddish back and a black bib on its chest.
This is a ringneck parakeet.
It is a kind of parrot.
Males have a red and black ring around their neck when they mature.
Females and young birds have either have grey neck rings or no neck rings at all.
If they are kept as a pet, they can be taught to speak.
This is a pigeon.
They often hang around cities and towns.
They are in the same animal family as doves.
Like farm animals, the pigeon was domesticated.
This started more than 5000 years ago!
Pigeons were used to carry messages.
They were also used in wars.
There are so many types of birds.
They all have their own quirks.
Looking after birds helps the whole world to be healthy.
They keep down bug numbers and spread seeds.
We need to protect our birds so that we can keep playing their roles.
The bird lands. He wants to make some pals.
Can he make a link with one of these animals?
She is mad.
She is not a fan of the bugs by her rump.
The bird takes care of it.
She wants to help him as well.
He will think of what she can do for him.
The croc has a sore tooth.
The bird tells him that he can get in there and try to help.
He went in.
It stunk, but he got a bit of junk out.
The croc wants to help him as well!
He wants to whip his tongue back and get at a twig.
The bird came to help.
He will help the bird if he can!
She thinks that the bird will pull a prank.
She is mad. She has not had a bite to eat all day.
The bird helps. She is safe to eat.
He wins her as a pal as well!
He thinks. Oh! They can help.
They can tell him what they think of his song.
Can we help?
Ted is not a fun kid.
Ted runs up to us to stop the fun.
Mum tells us to not get mad.
It is hard. Ted jogs up.
We ask him to stop. Ted does not.
We must plan.
We put on dots.
Mum drops us to the park in her van.
Ted spots the red dots. He jumps up!
He yells!
He runs off.
Ted left! We can have fun!
Ted is not fun to be mates with.
Ted is strong. He likes to make us sad.
Mum tells us that Ted will be nice if we are nice to him.
We try, but it does not work.
He acts like he is king.
He can tell that we want to go on the slide.
There are bangs as he runs up it.
When we walk off, he can still make us mad.
We make a plan.
We put red dots on our arms and legs.
When Ted spots the dots, he thinks that we are not well.
He does not want to be close to us.
We run. He flings his arms up and runs home.
It will be a fun day with no Ted.
We can go on with what we like!
I have a puppet. I can make him hop.
I pull on the strings so that he hops across the floor.
I often have him hopping down the path in our yard.
I can make my puppet stop.
If I stop moving the strings, he will not move.
I can still hold the strings up so that my puppet does not droop.
I can get my puppet to drop things.
Here he is dropping a small, red ball.
I can make his hand clench around the ball and release it.
Can I get my puppet to lick? No, he has no tongue.
That is something that my puppet cannot do.
No matter, my puppet can still do a lot.
I can get my puppet to put on a tap show.
I dress him in a top hat and dinner jacket.
He looks like he should be on a stage somewhere with the show he puts on.
Here is my puppet clapping.
I like to get him clapping while we are playing games.
It is like he can cheer on the team.
His wooden hands clunk as they clap.
I can make my puppet flap.
He looks like he is a bird flying in the sky.
It takes some tricky moves from my hands to get him to flap.
Can my puppet nap? No, he is just a toy.
But that means that he can play with me at all times.
Kicking is as hard to do as clapping, but I have a lot of skill with my puppet.
I can get him to kick out his foot on each side.
I can get my puppet to flick.
He can send a small, red ball rolling across the room.
It can shoot out fast!
The best thing is to make my puppet do tricks.
I can have him stand on his hands or his head.
Can my puppet get sick? No, he is just a toy.
He is good to go when I feel like working on my skills.
Book Four The Yowie and the Bunyip.
When they had gotten out of the machine after the min mins, Mrs.
Quigley had been asleep in her bedroom.
She didn't look well.
Ada wanted to wake her up and question her about the danger she'd put them in, but the others told her to leave it and wait until they went around the next afternoon.
Right after school, they went to her house.
When she saw the look on their faces, she looked a little frightened.
Didn't you enjoy the last read?
Ada grit her teeth. She had.
It was one of the best experiences of her life.
But she still felt like she was being lied to.
Luckily, we were able to figure out what was going on, Ada said.
But what happens if we don't?
Mrs. Quigley looked at the floor and bit her lip.
That has been a rather tragic part of the whole process, I will admit.
Darren started looking at some of the old newspapers around the room.
The ones that were the most well read had pictures of missing children.
He supposed that they had been other recruits.
So it's possible to... get stuck? Or die?
Oh no, no, no, Mrs. Quigley said. Not die.
But get stuck...? Lachlan asked.
Yes, I'm afraid so, she said.
I'll give you some time to consider that.
I'll be waiting down in the basement, if you choose to continue, she said.
When she was out of the room, the four of them seemed stuck in a heavy silence.
They thought about the two adventures so far.
They seemed so much more frightening now that they understood the consequences.
Well? Ada asked.
I feel like it's not even a question.
We could get stuck in there forever, Darren said.
Lachlan pursed his lips while he thought.
I don't know.
Those two books have been some of the best times of my life.
And we have done really well with reading them, Lachlan said.
Skink? Ada asked.
Maybe we can see how we go with each book?
And if one of us feels like it was too close, then they don't have to come back, Skink said.
That's a good idea, Ada said.
Any of us can leave at any time, no questions asked.
And yet, all four of them went down into the basement, let Mrs.
Quigley hook them up to the machine and waited for the world to disappear.
As the world of the book took shape, they found themselves in a crowd.
People were yelling about destroyed property, and a man was trying to talk over the crowd.
I understand your concerns.
I too have had things ruined.
My whole house was swept away in the last flood.
But no matter how far and wide we search, the beasts remain hidden.
What we have done is put together a substantial reward.
If any of you want to take this matter into your own hands, the money is yours.
Reward?! Ada and Lachlan said at the same time.
I certainly hope we aren't risking getting stuck in this world for a bit of money, Darren said with a disapproving look at the two of them.
Of course not.
It's for the experience, Ada said with a grin.
All the same, Lachlan said, let's get looking.
The four of them walked out into the bush and started searching for tracks.
Darren wished that they had stuck around and asked more questions first.
They weren't even sure what sort of tracks they were looking for.
Hours and hours went by.
But then, they started to find fruit that had been snacked on and odd clumps of fur that had snagged on shrubs.
Finally, they got a whiff of a cave with a foul smell.
They saw two, large shapes lumbering around inside.
Lachlan grabbed a large tree branch so that he could whack them over the head, but Skink was already ahead of him.
She had transformed into a little lizard and was climbing the walls of the cave.
Get back here! Lachlan whispered.
What is she doing? Ada hissed in a panic.
Maybe she's finding out if there is another way to read this story instead of just clobbering some poor beasts over the head, Darren suggested.
They wouldn't call them beasts if they were friendly, Lachlan spat back.
Then he jumped over a log and started to follow his sister into the cave.
Skink was already deep in the beasts den.
Before long, they began to hear her voice.
They crept closer and saw that she was talking to two monstrous animals.
One of them was like a large, hairy man.
The other was on all fours, with thick, shaggy fur and long whiskers coming out of its snout.
Skink was sitting at their feet, nodding at them in understanding.
The creatures narrowed their eyes and growled as the others approached.
Its alright, Skink said, putting a hand on the four legged one.
They're with me. Come on guys.
This big fella over here is a yowie!
And the cute, furry one is a bunyip!
They were not sure quite how cute the beasts were exactly, but the three of them walked into the dank, drippy cave.
Lachlan left the branch behind.
They saw deep tunnels at the back leading down into darkness.
Go on, tell them what you told me, Skink said softly.
Pictures started playing in their minds.
They saw groups of yowies roaming all over the land, and packs of bunyips by the water.
They watched as people came to hunt animals, cut down trees, and dry up rivers with their dams.
The yowies and the bunyips tried to protect the land, but there were too many people.
They watched as the cities grew larger and the yowies and bunyips grew fewer until only these two remained, trekking through their tunnels to try to keep the last wild places in the world from the people that wanted to destroy them.
Still want that reward now? Darren asked.
That bruised their egos.
Ada and Lachlan looked glumly at the poor beasts.
What can we do? Ada asked.
They told me about a place, Skink said.
They have been making a raft to get there, but every time they leave the cave the townsfolk try to hunt them down.
Then we just need a distraction, Lachlan said.
Skink focused on the bunyip and her body began to change.
Soon, she was as ferocious as the bunyip itself.
Lachlan tied her up and began walking her into town while Darren and Ada took the yowie and the bunyip through the tunnels to their raft.
When Lachlan and Skink got near the town, they got a lot of attention.
Then, Lachlan pretended to lose hold of the rope and Skink started to rampage through the streets, keeping all eyes on them as Darren and Ada began to cruise away with the yowie and the bunyip.
When they were far enough away, Skink ran out of town and the four of them met back up at the cave.
Did they make it? Skink asked.
Darren and Ada nodded.
It was a nice little place.
It might not be much, but at least they will get to live in peace, Darren said.
Lachlan smiled.
That suits me as a reward, he said.
This is Zom. He is sick of brains.
What else can he eat?
Is that an egg? It is off, Zom. It has gone bad.
Put it back on the.
oh. He wants the egg. Gross!
If he eats that, he will have the worst farts.
Is that wheat? It is, but it has gone off as well.
It is wet. It has slime and rot.
It is best if you just.
No, do not pick it up!
I guess the wheat is coming as well.
What is that? Sugar? But it is not white?
In it goes.
Why do you want all of these gross bits and bobs, Zom?
Old milk that is full of clumps?
That is the worst!
Come on, grab the milk.
I have to see what the plan is.
Time to craft. Egg, wheat, milk and sugar.
All of them old and gross.
What is Zom going to whip up?
A cake?!
Oh Zom, that cannot be better than brains.
Well, as long as he is glad. I am going to puke.
Have fun, Zom.
This is Skel. He just got a pet dog!
Skel loves his dog. But there is just one thing.
Dogs love bones, and Skel is made of them.
Why did you not think of that, Skel?
When Skel gets up, his arms are gone.
He looks for them in the main spots in the hut.
Ah. They are by the dog dish.
Did he just want a snack?
Skel thinks it is funny. He names his dog Bones.
They go on a hunt to gain skills.
Skel lines up a shot, then... clunk!
His leg is gone!
He hops all over the grass to chase Bones and get the leg back.
He will faint if this keeps up.
Skel thinks that Bones will grow out of it.
I am not so sure. He has your skull, Skel! Oh no!
You have no brain!
Skel gets why this will be a drag.
He will have to train his dog not to take his bones.
Skel trains Bones.
When he wants to take them, Skel is stern.
When Bones is good, he gets a treat.
Bones gets it! He wants to be a good boy.
He does not want to make Skel mad.
Skel trains Bones to play with sticks.
Skel can craft sticks in no time.
Skel takes Bones home. Oh no.
time to train some more!
Zom and Skel made up a game. Its name is Pig Race.
They point to a pig up high and they both try to get there first!
Skel got to the pig first! He wins Pig Race!
But where is Zom?
Zom did not get to the top of the hill.
He saw an odd thing in a hole in the cliff.
An odd egg. Zom wants it for lunch.
Skel thinks they can find its mum.
It is in tight, but they get the egg out.
They try a hen, but it is not right for the egg.
It walks off. It must not be a hen egg.
They try fish and squid. They swim by.
It must not be theirs.
They fly up to some dragons.
The dragons pay no mind.
There are no more animals by the cliff.
If they do not take it home, wolves or wights might get it.
They take it to Skel's hut.
He puts it by a warm torch.
The egg looks cool in the light.
There are taps coming from the egg.
Will it hatch that night?
Yes, the egg cracks open! A space spider!
It is not from their world.
Bones does not like the space spider at first.
He barks at it.
Zom loves it. He wants it as a pet.
He is so glad that Skel did not let him have the egg for lunch.
Zom shows Bones that the spider will not hurt him.
He names the spider Starfang. Zom has a pet!
One day when Zom went for a walk.
He saw a rainbow rabbit.
Zom saw that the rabbit had rainbow milk.
It made Zom pause and think.
Zom bred rabbits until he had a lot of rainbow ones.
He let the rest of the rabbits go.
Then he started to take the rainbow milk.
A lot of milk .
Zom made a cake pop! Oh no.
Did he use the rainbow milk to make that?
Oh no. Here come the villagers.
They want to buy Zom's cake pops.
Their kids are with them.
They think Zom has made a feast.
At first, one of the villagers is sick.
The cake pops cause them to spew rainbows!
Then all of the kids started to puke.
There was rainbow spew as far as the eye can see.
They all left. Zom did not do well. It haunts him.
Zom was sad. He only wanted to share.
He saw that a dog was still there.
The dog loves the cake pop! It made Zom glad.
A skeleton comes by. The dog is his.
It launched off when it got a whiff of the cake pops.
He wants one as well! His name is Skel.
Zom has made a friend.
Skel loves having Starfang at his home, but he blew up like a balloon when he came out of the egg.
There is not much room now.
Zom has a plan.
He said that Skel can go on a trip.
He will make the house bigger if he can live there as well.
Zom gets to work.
He takes out the old walls and goes with brick.
He keeps the sort of look that Skel likes but makes the house feel new.
Starfang is not sure.
He hides in a dark spot and makes a hiss.
Wow! Zom has done so much work.
He has made the front of the house so spooky!
He puts on a gross stew for when Skel gets back.
It is not long until Skel is at the door.
He loves that Zom kept the spooky look of the house.
Zom starts to give Skel the tour.
Starfang greets them.
Skel can smell the stew on the brew.
Skel loves the pets room.
Now he can sleep well at night.
They have a big bed of their own.
He says that Zom must get a new treat for Bones though.
We know why bones will not work.
Zom feeds Starfang and the pets go to bed.
There is just one problem.
Zom, you have not done the rest of the house yet!
Looks like you two will have to sleep with the pets tonight.
It is bath time.
Eloise wants more fun.
She makes small waves in the yard.
Eloise wants more fun.
The pool by the park! Eloise swims in the lanes.
Eloise wants more fun.
She swims on to the sea.
Eloise has scales! This is the most fun of all.
Eloise loves being in the bath.
In fact, she loves it any time that she is in the water.
She is great at swimming.
Being in the water makes her feel like she is at home.
Being in the bath was fun, but now she has a taste for more.
She will take her rubber duck out into the yard so that they can swim in the above ground pool.
Oh! The duck came to life.
It must be because there was more room to swim.
Eloise and the duck float about in the above ground pool.
They have a toy croc with them.
That was fun, but Eloise still feels like more.
Where can she go with her new duck friend?
She wants more room to swim. Oh!
The pool by the park!
Wow!
With more room to swim free, the croc came to life!
Eloise swims down the lanes with her new pals.
They find a toy shark that goes crunch'!
This pool is big, but where else could she go?
Where could she have more fun than the pool by the park?
Eloise thinks. Ah ha! They will have to go to.
A river!
They swim by the reeds on the banks of the river.
The toy shark has turned into a new friend too!
Beyond the river is the sea.
Will they make it that far?
Yes!
There is so much room to move that Eloise changes as well!
She has become a mermaid!
No wonder she feels at home in the water.
Diya is a big fan of butterflies.
She helps them if they are in odd spots, like chunks of mud.
The bus honks when her class gets to the garden.
The class gets off the bus.
Diya is still shy in class.
Diya starts to smile when she spots the butterflies.
They make her want to skip and twirl.
Miss tells them butterfly facts. Miss is so smart.
Diya puts her hand up to tell the class facts as well.
Butterflies have six, thin legs.
They are an insect.
It may look like they have two wings, but they have four.
Miss is glad that Diya wants to talk in class.
The kids like what she has to say.
They ask her for more.
As the butterflies dip and dart, Diya is not so shy.
She tells Miss and her pals more.
She tells them that a butterfly starts as a caterpillar.
The caterpillar makes a pod on a branch or plank.
Then it starts to change.
Diya makes a friend.
They see how many butterflies they can find by the pink flowers.
They wish they could tell what the butterflies think.
The butterflies fly up in the sky.
This kind are blue tigers.
Diya can tell the kids in her class so much.
They ask her more and more.
What a fun class at the butterfly garden!
Diya wants to go back.
The dog is up. He looks out.
What will he do with the day?
Mum is off to the shops.
Will the dog sit in the yard, or will it look for fun?
The dog got out! It can jump up in a flash!
The dog is in the next yard.
Who is this? He finds dog pals!
They have met at the dog park in the past.
Out comes a man. The dog is off!
What fun is in the next yard?
There is no dog in the next yard, but he scopes out a loud yip!
A big jump!
He lands on the grass and walks up to the sound.
Dog has found a pup on a lap. The pup yips a lot.
That was the loud sound.
The dog barks as the pup yips.
What's that? It is the sound of Mum's car!
He darts back to his yard.
Mum is back from the shops.
It makes him glad when Mum comes home.
She pats him on the snout and gives him a rope toy!
It was a big day for this dog.
Dog pals were fun, but time at home is the best.
Otters!
When an otter has kids we call them pups, just like we do with dogs.
Their mum will teach them what they need to live.
The otter and her pups go for a swim.
The pups have fun.
She tells them spots to hide.
They can hide in an old log or some rocks.
They must learn how to float.
Big otters spend a lot of time on their backs.
They spot a man with a net.
He wants fish, but otters can get stuck as well.
A trap that snaps shut. It cracks bones.
She tells the pups to give traps a wide berth.
She must teach her pups how to duck in the water to get by crocs.
The pups learn how to find a den.
They can learn while they have fun as well.
Their tails smack the water as they dive.
Some of them get fish. It is hard.
Their mum will share with them.
There is a lot to learn.
He is off to the shops. It is time to eat.
A fish and chip shop.
He likes fish and chips a lot.
He can smell fresh fish as well as chips with dip.
He will go and tell the man what he wants to get.
He has a lot of cash, but he must not spend it all.
He will get the fish burger.
With some chips on the side.
He gives the man the cash and says where he will sit.
The dish comes. Yum! It came with some dip.
He is full. Time to get rid of his trash.
He puts the trash in the bin.
He takes his plate to the man.
That hit the spot. Time to go home.
This boy has been playing at the park near his house.
His parents gave him some money to get lunch.
He is walking down to the shops now.
He feels like fish and chips for lunch.
He goes to this shop with his parents sometimes.
He knows the people that work there.
He knows the food is good.
When he walks in, his mouth starts to water.
It all smells so good!
Now he has to choose what he is going to order for himself.
The man working at the counter is Will.
The boy does not like to order from new people, but he knows Will.
Will smiles when he sees him.
He asks what the boy would like today.
The boy looks at the menu.
Maybe he will get something that he has not had before.
He asks for number five.
Number five is the fish burger with the lot.
That means that it has all of the salad that the shop offers.
It has sauce as well.
Number five also comes with chips on the side.
That is a lot of food for one kid!
We will have to see if he can eat it all.
The boy pays for his meal and points over to where he will be sitting.
The man checks that he gave him the right amount of cash and puts it in the till.
Will brings out his meal.
It is just what the boy felt like.
He is glad that he tried something new.
Will gave him some sauce for his chips.
There is very good service at this fish and chip shop.
Wow! He finished it all! He must be very full now.
He sits for a moment to digest.
It will be good to have the walk home to help with that too.
The boy takes his plate to the rubbish bin.
He puts in the packets from the fish burger and the fries.
This helps Will to keep the store clean.
He had a great time at the fish and chip shop.
Now it is time to go home.
He will tell his parents about what he had for lunch.
They will be proud he tried something new.
Book Five The Gympie Gympie Tree.
Even though the children had made a deal that none of them were obliged to go to Mrs.
Quigley's house each afternoon, they still all found themselves there the next day.
Even though the stakes were high, they didn't want to miss out on any of the experiences that the books had to offer.
However, Lachlan noticed that Darren looked a little queasy when the next book came out.
Are you alright? Lachlan asked.
Ada and Skink turned to see Darren looking white and pasty.
Yeah, it's just that, he said, pointing towards the peeling, green cover of the book.
Ada looked at the spine. What's a gympie gympie?
Ada asked.
Oh, only one of the worst plants in the world, Darren said.
It just makes you feel like you're on fire for months.
That's all.
Well, best make sure that you don’t touch it then, Lachlan said with a grin.
When they entered the world, the children found themselves in one of their most bizarre scenes yet.
There were hundreds of people gathering weapons.
Almost the whole town was getting ready to set out into the forest that surrounded their home.
A young man was running between the different members of the town, begging them to think their actions through.
They didn't appear to be taking it well.
The children approached him and found that he was a botanist.
What’s happening? Ada asked the man.
I came here to study an odd strain of the gympie gympie tree that I have heard stories about.
The residents say that it runs through the forest, uprooting itself and seeking out people to sting.
Usually there would only be a few incidents a year.
However, since I began to study it, it has become more aggressive.
Skink looked around at all of the tools in horror.
Are they going to cut down the whole forest?
she asked. The botanist nodded.
Too many people have been attacked.
They are going to clear out the trees until they find the gympie gympie and put an end to it.
They are saying I'm a phony and have brought nothing but hurt to their town.
I want to leave, but I can't knowing what they plan to do to that forest.
The children looked around at the scenic views.
They tried to imagine what the town would look like surrounded by tree stumps and broken limbs.
Maybe we can help, Lachlan offered.
Darren gulped audibly.
The only way that you would be able to do that is to find the gympie gympie before anybody else can, said the scientist.
You say that it likes to seek out its prey?
Ada asked.
Like some sort of nymph of the forest?
Darren winced. He knew what was coming next. Yes.
I think it can catch the scent of people that are frightened of it, the botanist said.
If you could find a way to make it stop attacking and bring me back a cutting, I think that would satisfy everybody.
They would think it was dead, and I could use the cutting for my studies.
Darren looked around helplessly.
Alright, he groaned. You can use me as bait.
For science.
Wonderful, Ada said, giving him a clap on the back.
The four children descended down into the trees.
Skink decided she didn’t want to risk getting stung.
Darren, is there anything that can't get stung by a gympie gympie?
A pademelon.
They can eat them, he said, wishing he had chosen to be something other than himself as a character.
Excellent, Skink said and promptly transformed.
She started hopping through the dense bush with ease.
Suddenly, they heard a rustling in the bushes.
Then a tiny plant started sprinting at them on its roots at full speed.
It was headed right for Darren.
Skink bounded forward and tackled the little plant, just as it was about to reach out and sting him.
Phew!
Darren said as he realised how close it had gotten.
Can you understand me?
Ada said, bending down to the little tree.
It bent its upper branches forward and back as if it were nodding.
You’ve caused a lot of trouble around here, and now the whole forest is in danger, she said.
It dug its roots into the ground and curled its leaves.
Were you angry that the botanist was trying to catch you?
The tree drooped a little, but did its nodding again.
He wasn't trying to hurt you.
He just wanted to understand what makes you special, Ada said.
And your only trophy for what you've done will be the forest in ruins.
Wait, Darren said from far back.
He stepped forward cautiously. It isn’t its fault.
Not really.
It just doesn’t want anybody coming after it or being in its space.
We shouldn’t be angry at something just because it does something that we don’t like or doesn't want to follow our plans.
I'm sure it has different plans to sitting in a lab for the rest of its life while that botanist pens papers and makes graphs about it.
The rest of them thought about that for a moment.
But if it doesn’t stop, everything around us is going to be torn down, Skink said.
Darren looked at the gympie gympie tree.
The only way around it would be if you stop running around seeking out people to sting.
You could live in the forest, but they would have to think you were dead, Darren said.
It was still for a moment, then nodded again.
And we would need to take one of your branches back as proof that we tracked you down.
The gympie gympie tree nodded and held out its largest branch.
Skink took it in her mouth.
Then the gympie gympie tree ran off into the wild.
As they started to take the branch back to camp, Darren felt the anxiety leaving him.
He was glad that he had been able to stand up for something that he didn't like.
He wondered if he would have felt the same if it hadn't been able to move and interact with them.
He hoped so.
The children ascended back up through the forest to where people were beginning to hack away at the trees closest to their homes.
They took the cutting to the scientist, who accepted it carefully in gloved hands.
He rushed off to tell the residents that the threat of the tree was over.
Ada put an arm around Darren, and for one of the first times in his life he felt brave.
He decided that next time he had to go up against one of his phobias, he'd try to understand it a bit better instead of just running off.
Well, at least before running off.
Book Six Lyre, Lyre, Pants on Fire!
The next time that the children entered a story world, it opened up to a school.
That’s no fun, Lachlan said.
Yeah, Ada complained.
We just spent all day at school and now we have to sit through more?
I hate this book already.
Do you really think that this is just going to be a book about boring classes?
Have any of the other books let us down?
Darren asked.
Ada and Lachlan muttered, but they knew that Darren was right.
Skink and Darren were chipper as they walked through the gates, but Ada and Lachlan lagged behind.
Ada resigned herself to being inside all day instead of having an adventure.
I hope you don’t have to go to a different class, Lachlan to Skink.
When they got a better look at the place, they realised that the school only had one main hall.
The bell rang and they lined up with the other children.
A strict woman marched them into the classroom where they had assigned seats.
She’d put the four children at each corner of the classroom with other students between them.
There was a dilapidated book on each of their desks, some paper and a pencil.
Open to the first page and write, she instructed.
Until when? Ada asked.
Until you have finished the whole book.
When you need more paper, raise your hand, the teacher snapped, condemning them to hours of copying.
Ada stifled a groan.
She looked at the books on the desks around her.
They had all gotten different animals.
She loved reading about animals, but doing it this way was going to be torture.
Worst of all, she'd gotten birds.
Birds were so boring.
A girl seated next to her raised her hand. Miss?
The teacher prowled over and hovered above the girl.
What is it? she growled. This book isn't right.
Excuse me? This fact. It's wrong.
Do you still want me to copy it out?
The teacher drew back her lips in a snarl but no sound came out.
You think that you know better than BOOKS?
Not all books, the girl said. Just this fact here.
It says that they all lay eggs.
Some of them give live birth, Miss, the girl said, pointing to a column of text next to a picture of a large, coiled snake with bands all along its body.
The teachers head jolted back.
Ada saw the fear in the girl's eyes.
You may omit that fact, she said, not taking her eyes off the picture as she backed away.
Not long after that, a strange noise came from outside of the window just next to Ada.
It sounded like a phone alert. YOU!
the teacher shrieked at Ada. Stand.
Ada got up.
The teacher made her turn out her pockets.
I know I heard a phone, she said, gnashing her teeth.
I think it was outside, Ada said.
Outside OUTSIDE? There's nobody outside!
You will keep going with your work, but now you will not have this, she said, taking Adas chair away.
And if I hear that phone again.
Ada sighed and awkwardly tried to keep writing while she was standing.
Lachlan looked over at her solemnly.
When it was nearly lunch time, Ada heard the phone alert again.
This time, she lost her desk and had to wrap the paper around one half of the book and copy while she held it in her hands.
It made her wrists hurt.
She was thankful when the bell rang.
The four children sat around the side of the classroom during lunch.
Ada wanted to see where the noise was coming from.
There was thick bush to the side with trees and shrubs.
As they were chatting to each other, she heard the phone alert coming from behind some bushes.
The children walked over and found a lovely, grey bird looking up at them.
It had elaborate tail feathers.
Some of the tail feathers were fluffy and white and others brown and stripey.
I saw this bird just now!
In the book that I was reading. That's a lyrebird!
Ada said in an excited whisper.
The little bird opened its mouth, and the sound of the phone came out.
They can mimic sounds around them.
They do it to make their songs more unique, Ada said, grinning down at the little bird.
I know that look, Darren said with a concerned glance.
You guys head back to the school yard.
Give me a sign if she's coming.
I have some work to do, Ada said.
You're not going to go pull any pranks, are you?
Do you want to spend the rest of your afternoon copying things out of those books?
None of them exactly felt like campaigning for that idea.
The three of them walked off and watched as Ada crouched near the lyrebird, designing a new part for its song.
When the bell rang, she went back into the classroom with them.
Just after they had started copying things out of their books again, there was a new sound in the classroom.
It was a gentle hissing.
Darren, Lachlan, and Skink covered their smirks.
The teacher stalked around near Ada to make sure that it was not coming from her.
But the sound moved as something went along the windows outside.
Suddenly, she looked like a nervous wreck. SNAKE!
she cried as she went barrelling out of the door.
Ada got up and looked out to the street.
She saw that the teacher was already far off around the corner.
She turned to the rest of the class. We're free!
They all cheered as they rushed outside to play.
Ada walked around to the side to find her little lyrebird, but it was already back in the bush.
And as the world began to disappear, she heard beeps and hisses coming from the bushes and grinned.
Book Seven The Strangler.
When they arrived in the next story world, the children saw a bright street full of bustling homes and businesses.
They were used to seeing a problem right away, but started by just enjoying how carefree the place was.
It felt different to home.
Home had a heavy weight to it.
Almost like there was more light and colour in the faces of the people and buildings here than they were used to.
But just when they were considering playing with some of the kids on the street, Lachlan spotted a house that looked lonely and unkempt.
It filled them all with sadness, like it was something that used to be living and had died.
It sat under the shade of an old tree that had been consumed by a strangler fig.
The fig had claimed the house as well, stretching its vines through broken windows and under doors.
I've seen that sort of vine before, Lachlan said.
They take over a tree and kill it.
The roots cut off the tree's nutrients from the soil and the leaves spread out above it so that it can't get any sun.
As they walked up to the house, they tried to see if there was a way in, but the locks were still fastened.
They listened at the door and the windows, but they couldn’t hear voices inside.
Then, Skink looked up. Is that a guitar?
she asked.
The other three frowned in confusion.
They looked up to where she was pointing, and saw that she was right.
Lachlan began to climb the tree.
Skink transformed into a magpie and beat him up there.
She was standing on the guitar, plucking at it.
There’s so much up here! Lachlan said with wonder.
There’s books... clothes.
a whole house full of stuff.
Ada and Darren joined them up in the strangler fig.
The higher that they climbed, the denser the amount of items seemed to become.
That didn’t feel like a good sign.
Skink flew up to scout things out.
She saw large, brown sacs where the vines had coiled themselves around two forms and hardened.
The children climbed up to the sacs.
They saw a man’s foot sticking out the bottom of one.
A lock of long, curly hair came out the top of the other.
The children looked at each other with hesitation.
Lachlan moved forward first and began to unwind the vine sacs.
Inside of the sacks were two people.
They took a moment to adjust to the light and the sight of other people.
I'm sorry, do we know you? the man asked.
No, Lachlan said, we just found you here and it looked like you needed help.
The two of them kept blinking in confusion.
It was like their thoughts were moving slowly.
Is that your home down there that has been ruined by the tree?
Darren asked.
That isn’t a home. That is just a house, he said.
Each word was freighted with sadness.
But it is still ours. His wife nodded.
She turned to the children.
Thank you for coming up here to wake us.
It has been such a long time since anybody reached out to us that we just sort of gave up on being a part of the world.
That’s alright, Ada said quietly.
Should we help you start to move your things down?
Lachlan asked. They thought.
Well, it does all seem to be up here, doesn’t it?
the man said, turning to his wife.
Yes, I think this will do quite nicely.
We might have to order it a little more, but this could work, she said, nodding.
But the strangler is still alive, Ada said.
It is, but it is slow moving, the lady said.
We were still for a long time, her husband said.
We won't make that mistake again.
The children bid them farewell and began to climb down the strangler again.
They were happy that the man and lady seemed content in their new home, but it felt like there was a missing part of the story.
Something still weighed on them.
As they climbed down past the gowns and art supplies, they came back to the level where there were toys, children’s books, and tiny clothes.
You didn’t see another sac up there, did you?
Skink asked as she hovered around them.
The three of them shook their heads.
I guess that explains why they did not want to be a part of the world for a while, Darren said.
‘I wonder how old they were? Seven? Eight?’.
When they got to the bottom of the strangler, the world had not begun to disappear yet.
But then they started to hear music floating down from the top of the vine, and the tale felt complete as the world began to fade.
Book Eight Toadpocalypse.
The next afternoon that they were walking to Mrs.
Quigley’s Darren had a thought.
We are over halfway, you know.
She only has a few left.
They had all been thinking about that, but the other three hadn’t wanted to say it out aloud.
As if that stopped it from being real.
The books had taught them so much.
These might be the only other stories left in the whole world, Darren continued.
They were all silent for the rest of the journey.
Ada was sniffling.
She had caught something at school and was trying to fight it off.
It was the weekend, and there was no way that she was going to be spending her two precious days off sick in bed.
They let themselves in the house and went down to the basement.
Mrs. Quigley was there waiting for them.
The moment that they went into the story world, they knew that this was not going to be like the others.
Some of the stories had felt like they could have happened in their own time, in a town far away from the big cities.
Others felt like they were set long ago.
But this one was unmistakably the future.
The whole skyline was bleak and smoggy.
They all started spluttering as they drew in the polluted air.
There were small fires smouldering around the place, and the streets were littered with smashed in shop fronts and boarded up houses.
No people. No laughter.
They began to walk down the road.
Gross, Ada exclaimed as she placed down a foot and it made an audible squelch.
Her sneaker had sunk into a thick layer of goo that lined the ground.
She looked closer. It was organs.
Some of them seemed human, and others from something else that she felt she’d seen before.
Only way, way bigger.
Darren got down on his haunches to examine the stinking substance.
Remember when we watched that toad dissection in biology?
he asked, turning to the others.
Lachlan and Ada nodded. Skink looked very green.
What’s a dissection?
It’s when you cut open something that has died so that you can look inside, Lachlan said, trying to choose the least disgusting words possible so his sister would not contribute to the muck with her puke.
But how can that be?
These entrails are huge, Ada said softly.
Darren nodded and got back up.
They continued on down the road.
Sometimes their sneakers would be sucked into the gizzards and they would take a step in their bare socks before they would stand one legged, trying to wrench their sneaker free.
Now that they thought about it, the only light was from the fires.
There were no street lights or electric things turned on.
They were so used to the gentle hum in their own city.
It made them nervous to be in the middle of a huge city and to not hear the normal buzzes and whirs of life.
They went by an auditorium and heard hushed voices whispering at them.
Come on.
It’s just a story, Lachlan said as he walked into the darkness.
They found a group of humans huddled around each other as the draughts blew through.
The people explained that they had been cut off from one of the larger communities.
They had made attempts to get back, but it was all for naught.
They were clinging to golf clubs and pitchforks.
None of them would speak the name of the monsters that were hunting them, but one stammered out the location of the main nest.
He asked them to remember as many details as he could, as he was writing a book about their struggles in case they survived to tell the tale.
Maybe he could show it to a son or daughter some day.
The children followed the directions and made their way to the nest.
The closer that they got, the more Skink objected.
The sound projected far without all of the normal city noise, and soon the toads were upon them.
The foul creatures were at least twice the size of an adult human, with large pockets of fat and muscle bulging over their forelimbs.
They frowned their sharp brows as they looked down at the children.
They began to secrete white beads of poison on the sides of their heads, and the children took that as a threat.
They followed.
Inside of the nest, they found that the toads had caught a prisoner.
He began to speak as the toads watched.
He explained that the toads had been kidnapped and taken to this place long ago by careless humans.
They’d had no natural predators, and quickly took over.
Over time, they grew large and strong, Soon, they began to wonder why it was that humans got to live in lovely houses while they had their innards spilt all over the street.
That had started a war: one that the humans were not going to win.
They were taking their place in the natural order.
Just then, Ada couldn't hold it in any longer.
She sneezed.
It was a massive, mucus laden sneeze that ejected fine globs of snot all over the room.
A wave of panic went around the toads.
All of the giant, fleshy toads suddenly began keeling over.
The man looked to either side of him in disbelief.
He began to go from toad to toad and jabbing a foot in their bellies to see if they have really been stricken down.
How did you know that would work? the man asked.
Ada sniffed. I didn't.
Lucky break, I guess, she said.
I’m free! he yelled. We all are!
Ada gave him directions for how to get back to the group in the auditorium.
There will still a lot of toads about, and he would need a group to stay safe.
He was also going to have a lot more details for the man's book than they ever could.
The children walked around the city looking for other groups of people who needed protecting.
When the toads came, Ada let out almighty sneezes.
She also.
bottled some in a jar for them so that they could test and use it.
She had enough to go around.
Ada did not want to be sick for the weekend, but she was alright with it if it was going to knock out a few more ugly brutes before they headed home.
After they had taken care of all of the toads that they could locate and the world started to disappear around them, Darren got thinking.
Each book that they put into the machine got destroyed.
That meant that they would be the only people that ever got to read it.
As the people started to fade away, he wondered if they would somehow live on in their story world even thought the book had been destroyed.
He hoped so.
He hated the idea that it was all for them and nothing more.
Book Nine The Belly of the Beast.
What's that?
Lachlan asked as the town before them began to take shape.
The four children headed to the notice board.
It was filled with photographs and handwritten notes.
It felt ghostly. Some of them looked weathered.
They walked a little closer and started to read.
Each note was about a loved one that had gone missing.
It looked like this had been going on for years.
They couldn't stop looking from picture to picture.
The children felt like they might be able to solve the mystery if they just kept looking for clues between the people.
But they seemed like they were people from all walks of life.
It was almost like they had been nabbed by some ghoul.
They couldn't find any connections. Until.
Huh, Darren said.
The other three turned to him and waited for him to continue talking.
Is it just me, or do all of these stories have something to do with the water?
Ada, Lachlan, and Skink scanned over all of the notes again.
You might be right, Ada said. Boating accidents.
Beach trips. Fishing. Yeah!
Lachlan said, pacing up and down the board to check that he had read all of them.
One or two might have had accidents because they were doing something without being properly prepared, but not this many.
It’s not that much to go on though, Darren said.
I don’t know, Ada said, looking at the slow moving river to their side.
That might be a good place to start.
They trekked along the dark in the riverbank.
It was a clear night, so the moon and stars lit their way.
Sometimes the river would fork and they would have to choose a way to go.
Other times it would coalesce with others and broaden.
As the river got deeper, the rushing water was more and more audible.
After a while, it went out into the sea.
They walked as quietly as they could on the bits of leaves and sticks, trying to prevent making as much noise as possible.
It felt spooky, like they were being tracked by some ghast.
While they wanted to find whatever was causing the disappearances, they didn’t exactly want to disappear themselves.
But something else was moving along the coast, trying to stay hidden as well.
Before any of them could react, a gigantic crocodile launched itself out of the water.
With one snap of its jaws, it swallowed Skink whole and dashed back out into the depths.
Lachlan went to dive right in after it, but Ada and Darren held him back.
They weren’t prepared to lose two of them so quickly.
Mrs.
Quigley had said that they couldn't really die in a story, but they didn’t want to risk it.
They kept restraining Lachlan as they watched the dark water, thinking.
Skink opened her eyes and her brain went into overdrive.
She was looking down into a huge cavern with fleshy walls.
There was at least one hundred people in there and many more animals.
The way that the cavern was set up reminded Skink of a museum, but all of the animals were still alive.
There were signs to show where and when the creatures had arrived.
All of the people were coordinating with each other to keep all of the animals fed, safe, and happy.
Skink moved further into the cavern as the crocodile gulped down a good deal of fish.
People came to collect the food and found Skink looking around in wonder.
Hello dear, a lady said.
New to the crocodile, are you?
Skink didn’t know what to respond with, so she just nodded.
Welcome!
said a few others as they began to pick up the fish.
Are you stopping by for a quick visit, or do you plan on staying long term?
the lady asked.
I’m sorry, Skink started, but I have no idea what is going on.
They looked at her for a moment.
You mean you weren’t trying to seek out the crocodile?’.
She shook her head.
You just got eaten? asked a little boy.
Yeah.
She looked around the cavern to see a few more people taking notice of her now.
others were starting to prepared the food for everybody.
The crocodile sent down some roots and plants for the herbivores.
Well, we can get him to send you out right now if you’d like?
There must have been some mistake, the old man said.
How is that? Skink asked.
Well, the crocodile usually only swallows people who have heard the legend of his stomach.
We are animal lovers that travel all over the world in the crocodile.
Some people just want to go from one country to another to see the different fauna there.
Others, like myself, end up staying on and keeping the museum in order.
This is like a… natural history museum?
I love those! Skink said.
Well, I don’t know about history.
We keep all of our animals very much alive.
But it isn’t really a zoo.
The animals are free to leave when they want.
Some are looking for a new start because their home got destroyed.
Others have come to enjoy life in the crocodile.
Skink walked around the crocodile with the old man and saw the animals that were being housed in its stomach.
She met chameleons from Madagascar that could change their skin to all kinds of hues.
Narwhals with their long tooth tusks from the arctic in large pools of water that the crocodile gulped down.
Vampire squid from the deep sea with their little umbrella bodies.
She even started to see some animals that she swore had gone extinct, like the dodo.
It appeared that the crocodile had been at work for a long time.
There were otters and anacondas.
Squirrels and gharials.
All sorts of things slithering and scampering and flitting about.
Skink put on a show for the human occupants, transforming into some of their favourites.
Then the old man walked up near where Skink had fallen in, and knocked on the side of the cavern.
The crocodile opened its jaws.
She wanted to head back in case the other three tried to take revenge on the crocodile.
Could you do us a favour?
Please tell those on the outside that the people here are alright.
They will be back in time, but the adventure is too much to pass up.
Skink crawled up the throat and stood in the jaws, looking out.
The other three were on the shore and started screaming when they saw her in the crocodile’s huge, serrated teeth.
The crocodile brought Skink to the shore and she stepped out.
Then it closed its jaws and sank back into the sea.
On the way back to the notice board, Skink tried to explain what she had seen.
Even though they couldn’t understand, they helped her to reply to all of the notes.
Gone travelling. Be back soon.
book TEN Cassowary Country.
The next time that the children began to see a town taking shape, there wasnt too much of it left to speak of.
There were bits of houses and garden ornaments like gnomes all over the place.
It was muggy and close to a rainforest.
There were flies and gnats all around.
When they began to head into the area, they heard some scuffling from shrubs to the side.
Then, there was a deep, whooping noise that sounded all around them, followed by a barking cough.
I'm pretty sure I remember that sound, Lachlan said.
The other three imagined some beast gnashing its teeth a it watched them.
But soon, Lachlan found out that he was right.
A formidable bird came tearing out of the tall shrubs.
It stopped just short of them and made the barking noise again.
It had a tall neck atop a plump body covered in black feathers.
Its legs were scaly and ended in sharp talons.
And crowning the blue head with its enormous beak was a tall crest.
A cassowary.
All of the children were frozen to the spot.
There's no way we can outrun that thing, Ada said, breathless from fear.
Maybe I could transform and try to get it headed in another direction?
Skink said.
Lachlan stepped forward, looking at it right in the eyes.
Be careful!
Darren hissed, looking at Lachlan like he was a mindless fool.
It will gut you or rip out your jugular.
The cassowary was just staring back at Lachlan.
It tilted its head to the side, considering him.
Just then, a person came running out from one of the busted up houses.
She was carrying a large piece of corrugated iron like a shield in front of her.
In the other hand, she held a broom.
She began poking at the cassowary gently with the broom to get its attention.
Into the house! she yelled towards the children.
The cassowary reared up and kicked the corrugated iron.
The iron blocked the kick.
With the broom and makeshift shield, she looked like she was playing at being a knight.
Ada began to wonder whether she might be more capable than she appeared.
The children ran into the house.
From the window, they watched in amazement as the woman took blows from the bird, holding up the metal sheet.
She poked the bird with the broom again, then hurled the broom far off.
The cassowary ran after it, and she got back to the house safely.
Who are you?
Ada asked as the lady put her corrugated iron by the door.
My name is Emily, she said with a warm smile, not at all like the warrior she had been outside.
I live here. How? Darren asked in astonishment.
I've been here all my life, Emily said.
After the cassowaries took over, most people left.
My dad and I stayed.
They might be scary up close, but they are quite adorable when they arent trying to slash you to bits, she said with a laugh.
Adorable wasn't exactly the first thing that came to Darrens mind.
What do you do here? he asked.
Dad photographs them. I study them.
You get a few people coming through, wanting to see the town for themselves.
Then we spend most of our time making sure that people dont get killed and that the cassowaries keep safe.
Lachlan started walking around the room.
There were cassowary sketches, pictures and models all over the house.
Like Mrs.
Quigley's house, it was a total mess but looked well loved.
Wonderful, aren't they?
Emily said when she noticed Lachlan looking around the room.
Peerless in ferocity.
All birds might have come from theropod dinosaurs, but these ones play the part a lot more than others.
Theropod? Skink asked.
T rex, velociraptor, that kind of thing, Lachlan said as he kept looking around the house.
The feathered, two legged carnivores.
Why are they still attacking you? Lachlan asked.
What do they want?
Their land back, I suppose.
They need to roam wide, and people kept infringing on their space.
Year by year, their home grew smaller.
They wanted some of it back.
Why not leave them be then? Lachlan asked.
There are not many of them left, and we want to give them the best chance we can.
Dad and I are trying to grow back some of their forest.
We are taking the houses down as we go.
But we can’t get the right type of seeds to have enough diversity in what we plant.
We don’t know the right balance.
Those bushes and trees are deep in the forest, and the cassowaries won’t let us in there.
It’s not their fault.
They can’t know that we are trying to help.
Lachlan turned to face them all.
You remember when we saw the ones in the zoo?
They had a sign over them that said Rainforest Gardeners.
They eat lots of different seeds and berries and poop them out in other places.
They are the reason that other animals in the rainforest have so many leaves and fruits to gnaw on.
So? Ada asked.
Skink, we might need you after all, Lachlan said with a grin.
Skink and Lachlan went to the door.
He took the corrugated iron, a sack, a trowel, and a fresh broom.
Then Skink transformed, and he climbed onto his sister’s feathery back.
The others waited, looking anxiously out the window for their return.
Finally, they came back into the clearing and up to the house.
Lachlan leapt off Skins back.
Darren and Ada took the opportunity to get a look at her talons and odd, hooked wings up close.
Lachlan opened up the sac for Emily.
It was full of poop from different cassowaries.
The poo was rainbow coloured and had a huge variety of seeds.
Emily was very pleased, and went to get her microscope and books on plant types.
The children held their breath so that they didn't have to breathe in the stink.
The scene started to shift away, and it couldn’t have happened soon enough.
Book Eleven The Drop Bears.
Before the children knocked on Mrs.
Quigley’s door the next time they went around to her house, they stood on the front steps for a while.
Last one, Darren said.
Ada knocked on the door before they got too caught up in it being the last time that they might enter the house.
Mrs. Quigley didn’t answer. Ada knocked again.
Hang on, be quiet for a minute, Lachlan said.
There was a faint voice coming from inside, telling them to open the door.
Ada turned the knob and found that it was unlocked.
The keys were in the back of the door. Mrs.
Quigley was lying down on the couch.
She didn’t look particularly well.
She had a very pale complexion.
Would it be better for us to come back another time?
Darren asked. Don’t mind me.
You go downstairs and finish what you started, she said, shutting her eyes with a soft smile.
The children made her some tea and toast then went downstairs.
They got the machine working by themselves, and Ada dropped the book in the tank once they were all connected up.
She settled herself on the couch, and they set off for the last of their journeys into fiction.
As was the case with the other books, they arrived in a town that had a problem.
There were a lot of tourists visiting from afar.
They wondered whether there had been some sort of thieves, like the bowerbirds or the strangler fig.
They spread out and spoke to people in the crowd.
Skink found an old lady who had lost her son.
Lachlan spoke to an anxious man who had been attacked.
Darren found a bunch of young children clinging onto stuffed toys who told him what bits and pieces they had heard around the place.
Ada headed for a policeman, who told her about the spike in attacks and missing cases over the past few weeks.
It all had one thing in common: drop bears had come to town.
The attacks had happened in a few different places, but a lot of them were near the forest.
The children began to head that way.
They thought of all the missing people.
Images of bodies covered in flies filled their heads.
None of them had ever seen a body.
They hoped that today wouldn't be the day.
The children heard something moving about in the leaves, but it was just a family of foxes coming out of their den.
Then, there was an odd sort of howling.
The foxes fled.
The howling wasn’t really like that of wolves.
The closer that they got to the sound, the more that it was like gruff sort of bark.
There was also a noxious smell.
They looked up into the trees and found the culprits.
After all that the children had seen, they weren’t frightened of the little, grey drop bears.
They had nothing on giant toads.
Aw, Skink said. They are so cute.
No way have they been attacking people.
The drop bears came a little further down the trees.
They gave their deep, barking sounds, trying to frighten the children.
The children laughed and beamed up at them.
Hi there! Skink said.
The drop bears stopped their barking and looked around at each other.
One of them scooted a little further down its tree.
Why aren't you running off in terror?
one of them asked obnoxiously.
We’ve kind of seen a lot together, Ada said.
The drop bear frowned.
Its fellows scratched at the trees that they were clinging to, not sure how to take this new development.
Would you mind moving on then?
Somebody else might come through soon.
We need to give something a good scare.
We’re starving.
The children gave each other confused looks.
You live off fear?
Is that why you have come to town, just to scare people?
Lachlan asked.
Hey, everything has to eat, the leader of the drop bears said.
Do you scare people to death? Ada asked.
We have never scared a person that much that they dropped dead.
Sometimes the more cowardly ones just run off, frightened out of their wits.
I don’t know where they end up, but they sure aren’t dead.
The children thought about that.
Why do you move around so much? Darren asked.
We need to go from town to town because people come after us.
But we have never had people stop being frightened before.
There are a lot of tourists here, Darren said.
Might be a good place to set up a home for yourselves.
Different people coming through all the time.
But what about when they come for us?
the drop bears asked.
I think I have a way that we might be able to avoid that, Darren said.
He took the others aside and made a plan.
They went back into town and found the policeman that Ada had been speaking to.
They asked about an old shack that they had seen near the forest.
It looked long abandoned.
The policeman heard them out and spoke to the other members of the town.
Then he went into the forest to look for their lost.
The next night, everything was set.
The children had spent the day making the old wooden shack even creepier than it was.
There was a line outside of the new haunted house of people waiting to go in.
Most of them were new faces that they hadn’t seen the day before.
They collected money as people went inside, putting it in a box to give to the town at the end of the night.
When people walked in, they heard shrieks of terror, but as they walked out, they were laughing.
Some people even went to the back of the line to go through again.
At the end of the night, they had a lot of cash to give to the people who had been frightened by the drop bears in the forest, and more would come in every day.
The drop bears had full bellies and a home to call their own.
With the problem solved, the town started to disappear into the familiar sketches.
Book Twelve All Good Things.
A few weeks later, Ada told the others to meet her after school at the park around the corner.
When she was sure that they were away from any teachers and other students, she pulled something out of her backpack.
The object was covered in one of her winter scarves.
Still, the shape looked familiar enough.
That magic feeling rushed over them.
They had been inside reading boring, old biographies all day, and the other three watched with glee as Ada pulled some of the scarf away.
Just as they’d hoped, it was a book.
They saw a hint of teeth and claws on the cover.
Did you go to see Mrs. Quigley? Darren asked.
Nope, Ada said, beaming. I found it in my attic.
My parents went out to see a film together last night, so I started poking about seeing if I could find anything fun to do.
I spent the whole night reading it.
Well, until my parents got home at least.
It’s a really good one. You’re going to love it!
Best of all, there’s a giant box of them there!
I bet if you searched your houses as well, we would find more.
She had made her mind up that it was stupid to have burned the fiction books.
She bet that a lot of people still had them tucked away.
Still, that didn’t mean that they wouldn’t have to be careful.
Do you think they forgot about them when fiction was meant to be handed in?
Who knows?
But all they are doing there is getting dusty.
If you do find more, we could each bring in one every week and share it together.
Ada wrapped the book back up and put it in her bag.
If anybody saw them, it would doubtless be confiscated.
Worst of all, her parents could get in trouble.
She didn’t want her parents to have to face punishment because she had been careless.
The children began to head over to see Mrs.
Quigley, hoping that she would be alright with them using her machine for books that weren’t her own.
They were certain that she would invite the opportunity.
There were choruses of birds happily chirping away at each other.
They all liked the walk to Mrs. Quigley’s.
They had a lot of fond memories of the secret conversations that they would have on the way there, about the book that they had just read or speculating about what they would get to sink their teeth into that day.
Just when they thought that their journeys were over, another one had landed right in their laps.
When they rounded the corner, the world changed.
There was an ambulance outside of Mrs.
Quigley’s house.
Paramedics were rolling along a stretcher.
On top of the stretcher was a long, rigid, black bag.
Lachlan put a gentle arm around Skink.
The other three stood there, not knowing what to do.
Darren found himself walking up to the paramedics.
He confirmed what they were all thinking.
They asked if the children knew her, and Darren said no.
Ada was about to yell at him, but took a moment to think.
If they had found anything inside the house, it was best not to be connected with her.
Darren asked how she had died.
The paramedics said that it was of old age.
Ada breathed a little easier then.
She thought about what Mrs.
Quigley had said during their last visit about her stories living on in their minds.
Ada wasn’t the type of person that cried easily, but she found herself crying now.
A man who had lived next to Mrs.
Quigley’s came out as the paramedics drove the body away.
You’re those kids that messed up Edna’s garden, aren’t you?
Poor thing. She was a gem, she was.
That made Ada cry even more.
She hadn’t even known her first name.
She was embarrassed, but couldn’t stop it.
Lachlan and Darren each put an arm around her.
Skink was still staring off down the road where the ambulance had gone.
Yes Sir, Darren replied.
She said that you would turn up.
And to give you this.
He handed them an envelope.
There was a letter inside.
Ada knew that it was smarter to open it later, but she couldn’t help herself.
When they opened the letter, Mrs.
Quigley's words were preceded by the scent of her quirky home.
When they first entered it, they had found it old and creepy.
Now, it was comforting.
Ada quickly scanned the letter and placed it back in its envelope.
They thanked the man, then went down to the river near Mrs.
Quigley’s house.
She wanted us to break in, Ada said.
Ada got out the letter to show them all to prove it.
After 24 hours, the police go in to search the house and seize anything that shouldn’t be there.
But there is a law that stops them from doing that until then.
She wants us to go into the basement and take the machine out of there so that her husband’s legacy won’t be lost.
Ada and Darren called their parents and said that they were staying at each other’s houses to study.
Lachlan and Skink didn’t bother.
Their parents never cared about where they were anyway.
The children waited until dark, then crept up to the unguarded house like thieves in the night.
It felt dishonest somehow, even though it had been Mrs.
Quigley’s final wish.
They unfastened the window to the basement and then Lachlan and Ada jumped down.
Piece by piece, they took the machine apart.
They handed the pieces up to Skink and Darren.
They fit most of the bits in their backpacks and put the tank under a few jackets.
Then Lachlan and Ada came back up.
Together, they lugged the parts over to Lachlan and Skink’s house.
Their parents were watching television, and didn’t get up as the children came in.
Just us, Lachlan said.
Darren gave him a panicked expression, but Lachlan seemed confident it was ok.
Their parents grunted in response and kept watching television.
The children went down to the basement.
They never come down here, Lachlan said.
They won’t notice a thing.
The children realigned all the parts of the machine.
They gave each other worried looks before they flicked the switch, but it turned on and booted up just like normal.
The odd liquid in the tank between to swirl.
Well, here we go… Ada said, getting ready to put the book into the tank.
Each of them thought of Mrs.
Quigley as they strapped the machine to their heads.
Then, a new world began to appear.
Get to bed.
A hat for a nap.
A spot to nap?
It is not.
A spot to rest?
It is not.
A bed spot?
It is not.
A spot for him?
Not the spot.
A spot at the top.
A nap at the top.
A sloth moves slowly, but they still get worn out.
This one needs a nap.
It is time to find a spot to curl up.
It has found a good tree.
The tree is tall and has a lot of branches on it.
There will be a spot to nap for sure.
Hmmm. Is this the right spot?
It has a good curve to it.
The sloth can cling on tight as it sleeps all night long.
Oh! This spot was not free.
The sloth has green moss on its fur.
The giraffe thought it was leaves.
The poor sloth got bitten. Up you go, sloth.
Find a new spot.
How about this spot? There are no giraffes here.
This seems like the perfect spot to hunker down for a good nap.
Oh! There is a hive of bees next to this spot!
This will not do at all.
You will get stung all over if you nap here, sloth.
I do not think that is a good spot, sloth.
I can see a tail on the branch.
I think it might be a.
Oh no! That poor snake. Let it go.
It was just trying to have a nap as well.
Keep on up the tree, sloth. This is not the spot.
This might be it.
A bird has the branch above, but the branch under it looks free.
Your eyes are nearly shut, sloth.
You need a spot now!
Oh.
I do not think you will get good sleep like that, sloth.
That bird will keep you up.
It will caw the whole time.
It was a long way to the top of the tree, but you found a spot!
Good job, sloth.
Now I will leave you be so that you can nap.
This tree is all full for the night.
If there are more critters that want to find a spot to nap, they will have to move on.
The dog spots a tin.
It tips the tin. Oh no!
The dog goes up to the cat.
The cat jolts.
The cat is mad.
The dog and the cat are in a ball.
The dog is mad. It runs to get the cat.
Oh no. It is an art day for Pam.
Pam yells. She drops the tin.
The dog and cat go by and by.
The dog and cat stop.
The dog and cat did art for Pam!
This dog is by a tin. What is in the tin?
Is it full of food?
Oh no! The tin is not full of food at all.
It is full of paint. The dog runs in the paint.
The dog finds the cat. He loves mess.
He wants the cat to have fun as well.
The cat gets a fright. The dog is white.
Is this a new dog?
No. It is the old dog. Now the cat is mad.
There is red paint on its fur.
It jumps at the dog like it is prey.
The dog and cat start to fight.
They fight in a ball as they bite and scratch.
Yellow and red mix to make orange.
Off the orange cat and dog go.
Oh no. It is an art day for Pam.
Will the cat and dog run by Pam?
Her cat and dog jump up. Pam gets a fright.
The brush and pot fly off.
The dog and cat go by so fast.
Where does the cat end and the dog start?
Oh! The dog and cat are both grey now.
Some of their paint came off.
Hey! They made some art for Pam!
Here is a small, white dog. It has found a tin.
Does it want to flip the tin and see what is inside?
It could be some food. It could be some toys.
The dog tips over the tin. Oh no!
It is not food or toys. It is paint!
This dog loves to make a mess.
It runs, rolls and slides in the paint.
It is having the best time!
Now the small, white dog is yellow!
It goes to find the cat.
The cat is having a rest on some more tins.
Oh no... do those tins also have paint in them?
Yup. The cat gets a fright.
It lives with a white dog, not a yellow dog.
The tins tip over and red paint comes out.
The cat looks again. It is the white dog.
The dog just made a mess. That frustrates the cat.
Now there is red paint all over the cat.
The cat will get the dog back.
Oh! They are in a ball.
They are having a big fight.
The yellow and red paint is mixing.
They are turning the same colour.
An orange cat and an orange dog.
The dog is mad that the cat jumped on it.
The dog will get the cat back for that!
Oh no! It is an art day for Pam.
She does not see her pets.
She is trying to think of a new thing to paint.
The dog and the cat jump up. Pam gets a fright.
The brush and pot fly off.
Black paint falls out of the pot in big globs.
She yells. She berates. They will not stop.
Pam wants to placate them. They will not stop.
They run all over her canvas as they try to catch each other.
In the end, both the cat and the dog are too dizzy to keep going.
They land on their backs.
They are covered in colours now.
Pam picks up the canvas. She rotates it. Wow!
The pets made art!
Art days do not always turn out how we think they will.

Her mum and dad got her a pet as a gift!
Will it be a pet that makes a mess?
Will it be a pet that is a lot of work?
Will it be a pet that has quills?
A pet that smells?
A pet that can squash?
A pet that must get a lot of grub?
A pet that hugs?
A big pet that bends the bed?
No. Those are not the best pets for gifts.
The pet is a pup!
It will be a bit of work and make a mess, but not a lot.
A pup is the best pet for a gift.
It is Lisa's birthday!
She has always wanted to have a pet.
Her parents told her that this is the year.
She has not heard what kind she is going to get.
What will it be?
Will it be an elephant?
An elephant would break the house.
It would make a big mess.
It would slurp things up in its trunk and trumpet them out.
An elephant is too big to have as a pet.
Will it be a croc? A croc would be a lot of work.
Lisa would have it keep its teeth clean.
She would need to wash its scales.
A croc could also snap her up as a meal.
How about a porcupine?
No, it could shoot spines that embed in their skin.
It would not be safe for her brother.
It would not be safe for her.
Her parents would not be a big fan of the spines either.
Will it be a skunk?
No, a skunk would make such a stink.
It would spray its smell all over the house.
All of the party guests would flee.
Skunks are very cute, but they would not make a very good pet.
Will it be a rhino?
No, a rhino might break the house even quicker than an elephant.
It would go through walls and chase her brother.
A rhino is solid like a tank.
There is no way that her parents would get her one of those.
How about a lion?
No, a lion would need to eat too much meat.
Lisa thinks that it would be a smelly beast to feed.
It might also eat her brother all up!
Her parents would not be so keen on that.
A snake? They have cool patterns.
Lisa likes snakes, but she does not think that she would like to live with one.
A snake might want to hug too tight.
That might be too much love.
Will it be a giraffe? No.
A giraffe would grow too tall.
It could not live in the house.
A giraffe would not make sense as a pet any more than the others would.
So what then?
What kind of pet is Lisa going to get from her parents?
If she cannot get a pet that will be too tall or stink too much or hug too tight, what kind of pet is it going to be?
Ah ha! A puppy!
A puppy makes a bit of a mess, and it can stink a bit too.
But it cannot break down the walls or eat her brother.
Yes, a puppy is the perfect pet.
Lisa loves him at first sight.
He has a bandit mask just like she has for the party!
Lisa hugs her birthday pup. It licks her cheek.
It is the best birthday gift that she could ever hope for.
It is time to meet the caterpillar crew!
They will be butterflies when they grow up.
Snack time. Caterpillars like to eat green leaves.
They eat a lot.
This is an odd caterpillar!
Look at the lumps and bumps on it.
A caterpillar with more than a few spines.
These keep the caterpillar safe.
A caterpillar that looks a lot like the rock it is on.
A caterpillar with a stripe on its side.
The stripe looks like it glows.
A small caterpillar. It has fine spines like fur.
This caterpillar looks like it is a plant with spikes.
A caterpillar with a lot of fuzz.
This caterpillar grew long bits that curl at the end.
Such long hair on this caterpillar.
Which end is which?
A new pal!
We can pop it back in the yard so that it can thrive.
A caterpillar is a bug.
They eat a lot.
This one has lumps and bumps.
These spines help it to be safe.
This kind have hard skin.
This one has a big line on its side.
This is a small one.
A fat one with dots.
These kinds have a lot of fuzz.
This caterpillar has stripes and curls.
This one has soft hair that bends.
This one wants to spend time with us. Hi!
It is a trial to be a caterpillar.
Birds like to grab them as an easy snack.
They need to protect themselves in different ways so that they do not get eaten.
The red spots along this caterpillar are like eyes.
That is one way to make a bird think again.
A caterpillar can also have a sickly colour.
These yellow bands say that it is not a good move as a meal.
A bird might think that they will get sick.
A lot of animals with bright colours in nature have poison.

When dinos roamed around, the world was not like it is today.
When we find their bones we can get some clues as to what it was like.
We can think about how they would have looked and the way that they would have led their lives.
Do you wish that dinos were still here today? Ok.
For a moment, let us think about what that would mean.
If that was true there could be dinos on farms.
We might even keep the small ones as pets.
And there would be wild dinos at the park.
That would be fun.
Just like how you might see a bird by the slide today, there would be dinos there!
Birds come from dinos after all.
What if they were as smart as us and could use our bikes and cars.
That would be a crazy sight to see.
I hope they would be good drivers.
What if we had to shop side by side with dinos?
Would they go crazy when there was a good sale?
Some people do that.
Or would they just be like they were at the time and not fit in with our world?
Yes, I think it would be like that.
They would break things without even meaning to.
Life could not be like it is today.
We would have to stop games when a dino went on the field.
It would be funny, but it would not be safe.
That dino could send a person flying with one whack of its tail!
And think about how much food they would need to eat!
There is no way that we could grow enough food to keep a bunch of dinos alive.
It is hard enough to grow food for all of the people on Earth.
And what would you do if you came home one day and found a dino in your house?
That gives me chills to think about.
The whole world would be a mess!
They would eat the trees and break the trucks.
They would smash the shops and eat people all up.
Dinos ruled their world.
We mammals only got a chance to rule when the big dinos died out.
Yes, it is sad. They were so cool!
But the best thing is that we are learning new things about dinos all of the time.
In fact, we are now finding more dinos than ever before!
We find about fifty new kinds of dinos each year at the moment!
Even if you are not out on dino digs, you can still learn a lot about these cool beasts and enjoy them for what they were.
Earth had a lot of dinos in the past.
If the dinos did not die... dinos would be cute.
But.
They would be at parks by the slide.
Would they ride on bikes?
If dinos did not die, they would go to the store.
They would snap lines.
They would stop games.
They would eat up all the grub.
If dinos did not die, they would get in our homes.
It would be a full on mess! It would not be safe.
But dinos did die. We find bones and prints.
And we can still love them.
There were a lot of dinos on the earth long ago.
We have found their bones.
For a brief time, let's say that dinos did not die.
Just like how we see birds at the park, there would be dinos on the slide and swings.
Or would they be smart and live by our side?
Would they go to the shops and choose what to buy?
Or would they break the things that we have made?
Would they stomp out on fields and make games come to a halt?
If they found our food, there would be none left.
In fact, they would go all through our homes and take our things.
The whole world would be a mess!
We could not live like we do now.
Dinos are cool, but the chief thing to take from this is that we could not live side by side.
But we can wield tools and toys that can tell us what dinos and their world was like.

Her mum tells her that she will be ok.
If she does not like it, she does not have to keep going.
She should just give it a try.
Anika ducks her head under.
She does not see how to use the spout well yet.
She gets the salty water in her mouth and spits it out.
She tries again a few times before she heads any further out.
She looks down.
She can see bits of algae and other things floating in the water.
They are almost like balloons.
They look like they might deflate if she touches them.
She finds a baby turtle. It is just a hatchling!
The baby turtle went from the sand into the sea like Anika did.
She follows it further out into the deep.
Wow! A flying fish!
Anika follows the fish up to see it jump through the waves and into the air.
It soars along and then plops back into the water.
She has found a reef!
There is coral in all colours.
There is a lionfish and a cuttlefish.
There is also a big, golden rock.
Oh! It's not a rock. It's an octopus!
It detaches and shoots off, but Anika tries to keep up.
She wants to see what it does.
It keeps changing colour and shape!
It moves in such an odd way. Anika gets closer.
It's gone from gold to red to blue to purple.
Anika watches as the water rushes through its mantle.
The octopus is scared. It gives her a nip.
She takes a detour to give the octopus room.
It just wanted to get away.
She will keep that in mind with the other animals.
Anika lands on the seabed.
A ribbon eel darts out.
She has learned her lesson.
She gives it room so that it can flee.
It is such a cool thing to watch sea animals.
She feels very lucky.
She starts to head back.
Then she sees a manta ray!
It looks like a bird flying in the sky, but it does not leave the water.
It does not have wings like a bird, but it looks like it.
As she gets to the top, she sees dolphins.
They can see that she wants to get back to the shore.
The dolphins swim with her and keep her safe.
Anika had such a great time in the sea!
She has a debrief with her mum and tells her about all of the things that she saw.
Her mum is so proud that she gave the sea a try.

A fox will act a lot like a dog.
They lap to get a drink.
A fox by a farm.
A fox on a stump.
A kit!
It will get to be smart and quick as a big fox.
A fox in the woods.
It scratches around in the moss and logs as it looks for a good meal.
When a fox cannot find a bird, mouse or frog to eat, it will snack on worms.
Foxes like meat, but they need fruits and grasses as well.
Foxes like to find a safe, dry spot to sleep.
If they are near a town, they may have a nap in a barn or some trash that has been left around.
Here is a fox that found a box.
Foxes that live near towns often have to find new ways to live.
A fox in the snow.
They do not sleep through the cold months like some bears.
Foxes can smell food under the snow and dig down.
They grow a thick coat to keep out the cold.
There are a lot of types of foxes.
These are bat earred foxes.
These foxes are on lookout.
Most of the time, a bat earred fox munches and crunches on bugs.
This is a fennec fox.
These foxes live in the desert.
A fennec fox is small and quick.
It rushes to catch insects that jump, like crickets.
It does not get stuck in the sand as it is so light.
An arctic fox. This fox is at home in the cold.
It has a white coat so that it can sneak up on prey.
Arctic foxes will walk a bit behind polar bears and eat the scraps from the meals that these bears leave.
This is what it looks like when a fox sheds its coat.
See the long fur? That is what comes off.
It is too hot for that now.
A fox will rub against things to make the old fur come off.
It has a new coat under the old one.
Foxes and dogs are alike.
They are in the same family.
Wolves are in this family too.
Animals in this family like to live in a pack.
They like to play. They hunt and have long snouts.
They can crack bones with their strong teeth.
Foxes drink like dogs as well.
Have you seen how a dog laps at water with its tongue?
They curl their tongue to scoop up water and send it down their throat.
Foxes do the same.
Some animals are good at living near towns.
Foxes are one of them. They are smart.
They find ways to get food on farms.
They make their dens near there so that they can come back.
This fox has found a spot to sit in the sun.
It is on an old tree stump. It is the right size.
A lot of animals like to laze about in the sun.
It feels good to warm up.
It gives vitamin D as well.
Here is a kit.
Foxes, dogs and wolves make great mums.
They play with their young and give them milk.
They keep them safe when they are small.
Then they teach their young how to hunt and find all that they need to live well.
Di is a litterbug. Her mum gets mad.
Litterbugs fill the world with junk.
The next day, there is junk in Di's bed.
The junk drifts with her.
Di's pals hate it. It smells bad.
They run to be rid of the junk.
Di is left with the rats.
Di is sad that she is a litterbug.
She wants to stop.
She runs, but the junk and bugs come for her.
Di spots a litterbug drop a skin by a bin.
She tells them to stop.
Di gets all of the junk that she can and puts it in bins.
There is less and less junk by her.
That is how to stop it!
Her pals are glad she is not a litterbug now.
Di is a litterbug.
She likes to throw trash and watch it fly.
The next day as she wakes up, there is trash by her bed.
It stinks!
It goes with her like a cloud.
It takes all of her joy.
The girls and boys hate it.
They tell her to clean up.
Di is left with the rats for pals.
She feeds them scraps.
Di tries to hide from the world. She feels gross.
Di does not want to be a litterbug.
There is no trick or ploy that will help.
She just needs to change.
She runs, but the junk zooms with her.
The flies come too.
Di sees a litterbug throw trash on the street.
She tells them not to be a litterbug if they do not want to end up like her.
Di starts to grab all of the bits of trash that she can find.
She puts them in bins.
The more trash that she puts in the bins, the more the cloud shrinks.
It is all gone!
Her pals are glad that she had a big clean and is not a litterbug now.
Diane is a litterbug. It makes her mum sad.
She gets angry when Diane throws rubbish on the ground, but Diane will not change her ways.
She does not care about trash.
The next day when Diane wakes up, there is a cloud of trash over her bed.
It stinks! Flies buzz all around.
Is this because she was a litterbug?
She gets up and gets ready for class.
The trash cloud drifts with her to class.
The flies love it, but Diane does not.
She sits in the corner and mopes about how much she must stink.
Why was she such a litterbug?
Now she must live with trash.
Diane's friends hate the cloud of trash.
They are not litterbugs.
They think that she is gross. They point and yell.
Diane does not know what to do.
The cloud of trash will not go away.
Diane is minus her pals at lunch.
They do not want to be near her.
The only friends that she has are the rats and the flies.
It is awful to feel like you stink.
She hides. She does not want to be seen.
Diane thinks.
There must be some way to get rid of the trash.
She tries to grab it, but it is too high up.
How else might she get rid of the trash?
Diane sulks. She walks off with a vacant stare.
She walks along thinking of all of the times that she has thrown things on the street or out of the car.
Each time haunts her.
She wants to be better, but she does not know how.

Diane grabs all of the trash that she can.
She puts it in the right bins.
Food scraps in this one and cans in that.
She sorts glass from paper.
Is the cloud of trash starting to shrink?
Yes! The rats are helping her.
They gather more and more trash so that they can put it in the right bins.
With each piece of rubbish that they pick up, they are making the world a bit cleaner.
Diane has done a lot of hard work.
She has changed.
Her friends are glad that she is not a litterbug now.
They can all play in a clean and green world.
Zara did tests with microbes in class when she was in school.
She set a goal to get a job in a lab.
Now she works in a lab. She works with microbes.
They are so small that she needs the right lens to see them.
There is a bad smell in the fridge.
She wants to test it.
She wants to test the fruit and see what makes it smell.
At first, Zara tries to just use the smell to think.
She cuts out microbes that do not fit.
When we sniff in, we take in parts of what made the smell.
It floats in the air.
Zara takes some of the flesh from the fruit.
She does tests on it.
She uses flasks to make sure she puts in the right amounts.
Then she waits. She checks the flasks each hour.
She takes notes when they turn dark.
She plates some of it.
Mold grows with a clear moat on the edge.
This will help her to cut out more microbes.
This one is a hard case, but she will get there!
With each test, the pool of microbes shrinks.
Each microbe needs different things to grow.
She uses tools to help her.
Tools in the lab must be kept clean.
Zara thinks that she has found a new microbe!
She tells her work pal.
He says he will test it too to check.
It is a new microbe! A toast to Zara.
She will do more tests to see what it can do.
Zara did biology when she was in high school.
She took a great interest in microbes.
She studied hard so that she could get good grades and end up in a lab one day.
All of that hard work paid off.
Zara now works with microbes.
It is her job to try to find microbes that we do not know about yet.
These microbes might be able to do great things.
There is a bad smell in the fridge.
Some fruit has gone off.
Zara is going to test the fruit to see what microbes are there.
She wants to see how they make the fruit rot and stink.
Zara starts by working on smell.
Since it is just fruit, this is ok.
She would never smell the flasks in the lab.
From the smell, she can start to rule some microbes out.
When we draw air in, tiny molecules go into our nose.
They tell our brain what we are near.
Zara has a good sense of smell.
She takes some flesh from the fruit and makes it into a solution.
She starts to do tests on them.
She keeps some of the solution as controls.
This means that she makes no changes to the solution.
For the others, she adds different substances and puts them under different conditions.
Zara checks each of the flasks over weeks.
She takes notes about changes that she sees.
After a few weeks, she puts all of these notes together as her data.
She can use the data to look for patterns.
Based on these patterns, Zara does more tests.
She plates some of the microbes on different kinds of mediums called agar.
Some are based on blood.
Some have a beef broth or yeast extract.
Different microbes feed on different agar.
When we see them, it means that they can grow on that kind of agar.
Some microbes react well when there is oxygen there.
Some react well when there is no oxygen.
While doing all of these rounds of tests, the list of microbes that it could be had shrunk a lot.
As she works, Zara keeps her tools clean.
This is an autoclave.
It keeps the tools clean by pumping in steam and making it hot.
This kills microbes so that they don't change the results of the tests.
Zara gets one of her workmates at her lab to run the tests as well.
She wants to be sure that he gets the same results if he does the same tests as her.
He does.
That means that Zara has found a new microbe!
We use microbes for all kinds of things.
Some of them help us make food and stop it from rotting.
Some of them help make our water clean.
They are also used in farming to look after crops and animals.
They are even used in medicine for our health.
What will Zara's new microbe be able to do?
Zara first did tests with microbes as a kid in class.
Now she works with microbes in a lab.
There is a bad smell in the work fridge.
She will test it.
Zara wants to find the microbes that make the smell.
She gives a big sniff. The smell hits her.
She gets a bit of the flesh and starts her tests.
Zara takes notes on her tests.
She starts to rule out some microbes.
She plates some of it.
There is mold on the plate the next day.
She does a host of tests.
The list of microbes gets thin.
Is it a new microbe?
She does her tests a few times.
She talks to a work pal.
He will do her tests as well to make sure.
It is a new microbe!
How will this microbe help us?
My hair is the best.

I need to wash and brush my hair a lot.
We get it cut so that it grows strong and looks neat.
But at times, I like to just have it as a mess for the day.
What can I say? My hair is the best.
I love my hair.
I keep it strong and in good health so that I can do lots of cool things with it.
You can change the way that you look when you style your hair.
In the summer I like to keep my hair up and off my neck.
It stops me from getting too hot.
It stops me from getting sunburnt on my head.
I love it in the autumn when I can run in the falling leaves.
My hair looks so nice with leaves and flowers in it.
As I run and skip along, my hair flows like it is a big wave.
In the winter, my hair keeps me warm.
I like to have it close to me.
It stops the breeze from making my cheeks cold.
It can catch snowflakes as they fall.
I got my hair cut short a few years ago.
I wanted to try it.
It was easy to care for it, but I missed my long hair.
I had to wait for a long time for it to be a good length again.
I love to flop down on the grass at the park and let my hair spread out.
It makes me feel like I am part of the plants and the ground when I lie down like that.
Cute bugs walks on my arms.
I like to shape my hair in odd ways for dress up days at school.
It takes a long time to style my hair, but I can make make it stay in some great shapes.
I like to hold things in my hair.
It is the best while I make art.
I can keep spare pens in there so that I can change out the colour I am working with in no time at all!
My mum sometimes says that my hair is like a birds nest.
What if I had real birds use my hair as a nest!
I think that would be great!
I would be like a walking tree.
When the wind blows, my hair floats along on the breeze.
It falls around me.
It looks cool when I am walking into the wind and my hair flies out behind me.
That makes me feel like a star.
My mum gets me a lot of fun headbands, pins and bows that I can put in my hair.
I like to change things up a lot.
Sometimes she does it in braids or pigtails.
I love how much I can do with my hair.
I do not think that I will cut it short again.
Short hair is easy to deal with, but I think that long hair is a lot of fun.
An otter and her pups.
The pups are off!
The pups go in an old log.
Otter mum has a bit of a rest.
A man. He has a net.
Otter mum says no.
The pups go by a big croc!
The pups rest.
Fun on the bank.
The pups try to get fish.
The fish jump.
Mum can help.
Here is an otter and her pups.
There are a lot of things that she needs to teach them.
As they get older, they will grow.
She needs to look after them until then.
One of her lessons is in swimming.
She shows the pups how to dive for food.
She shows them how to twist and turn in case they need to get away quickly.
She shows them good spots to hide.
Otters can slink into spots that a predator might not fit.
They pups can climb into this old log.
It will protect them.
Time for her to have a nap. The pups protest.
They want to do some more swimming lessons.
Their mum says it is good to rest so that they have the energy to do things when they need to.
They come across a man.
She warns the pups about nets.
He is not trying to catch otters, but they can get stuck in a net all the same.
She shows them a trap.
The otters think that the trap has sharp teeth.
Their mum says that it will snap shut if they touch it.
They must never go near a trap.
The pups slink by a croc as they learn more.
They can skip up on rocks and stay safe.
They do not get too close to the croc.
A croc's jaws are bad news.
This is where they live.
The trunk of a tree is a great place to sleep.
It is best to be out of sight during the night when there are predators about.
The banks provide a good spot to play and rest during the day.
Play is a good way to learn while they have fun.
That is also where they do their fishing lessons with their mum.
They do not go for dead fish.
They need to catch a live one and eat it on the spot.
Fish are not an easy thing to keep a hold of.
They slip out of their claws and flop back into the water.
With time, the pups will get better at catching and eating fish.
Until then, their mum will share.
She is the best at catching fish.
Their mum can do it all!
They can't wait to grow up and be just like her.
She will provide and protect for them until they can do it all themselves.
A girl at the park. She walks by a bad smell.
Oh! Pigs smell. It must be a pig. Hi, pig!
The pig can run fast.
The pig can go splat in the mud.
The pig sits by as the girl is up on a branch.
The pig fits her boots. The pig can go la!
Uh oh... it is Ma. She will not let the pig in.
They slip by.
The girl helps the pig get made up.
It does not work. Ma spots it. It must go. Or.
Get in the tub.
Oh! It is not a pig. Hi, pug!
This girl is at the park.
She is on a hunt for some fun.
She sniffs out a bad smell.
Hey! Is that a pig? Pigs are fun.
They smell bad too. She thinks it must be a pig.
The girl runs down the hill to see if the pig comes with her.
It keeps up.
They jump in some mud. Pigs love mud.
The girl gets muck on her dress.
She gets up in a tree. She loves it up there.
The pig waits for her to come back.
She puts her boots on the pig. They fit!
She sings and the pig does too!
The sun is low. Time to go home.
Oh no, mum is at the door! She will see the pig.
They sneak in.
They try not to make a sound so that mum will not send the pig off.
The girl loves to play with grown up things.
She shows the pig what fun it is.
Oh no! Mum has seen the pig!
She says that it will have to leave. Or.
Have a bath!
Mum does not mind the pig in the house.
She just hates the mess. They scrub.
Oh! It is not a pig. It is a pug!
She scrubs the pug clean so that they can play.
This girl is at the park.
She is looking for something fun to do.
She can smell something that stinks.
She thinks that stinky things are fun.
She tries to track it down with her nose.
Oh! It is a stinky beast.
She thinks that it must be a pig because it is so smelly and all covered in mud and dirt.
The girl wants to play with the smelly pig.
She runs down the hill and the pig runs after her.
It makes her glad that it wants to go with her.
Pigs love mud. She leads it to a puddle.
It splashes in the muddy water and has a great time.
So does she.
Her new dress and boots get muck all over them!
She climbs up a tree.
She loves to sit on a high branch and look out at the world.
The pig does not want to go up.
It waits for her to come back.
When she comes back down, she puts her boots on her stinky friend.
It starts to make a funny sound, so she sings along with it.
She does not want to leave the pig.
The sun is low and her mum will be mad if she stays out.
She will try to sneak the stinky beast into the house so that they can keep having a good time.
She waits until her mum isn't looking.
They tiptoe down the hallway so that they don't make noise.
Mum will kick the pig out for sure.
They have to sneak in so that the pig can stay and be her friend.
She loves to play with her mum's things.
She shows the pig how cute it is in lipstick and eyeshadow.
Oh no! Mum spots them!
Mum says that there is filth all through the house, and that it all leads to this stinky beast.
She says that it needs to go, or.
Get in the bathtub!
Mum does not mind him staying as long as he is not all covered in muck.
They scrub in the tub so that the pig can live with her.
What will it look like without all of the muck?
Oh! It is not a pig. It is a pug!
It needed a good scrub.
They will scrub until all of the muck is gone.
Then they can play again!

A mum and her kittens. She licks them.
A kitten in the yard.
A kitten up in hands.
This one wants to get to the top.
Some day, kittens will be cats.
Roar! Dinosaurs!
They were big and small.
Some went with pals.
Some went with none.
Some were tall.
Some were fast.
Some liked to graze.
Some liked to hunt.
Some went on four legs.
Some went on two.
Some had wild parts!
Give a roar for dinosaurs!
Roar! There were so many kinds of dinosaurs.
They did not look the same.
They did not act the same.
Some would hunt in a pack.
They would work as a group.
Some would hunt with no pals.
They did not like to share. They ate raw meat.
Some had tall necks and long tails.
They would eat from trees.
Some were squat, but they were fast and had sharp claws.
Dinosaurs that ate plants would graze all of the time, like cows.
Some dinosaurs ate both plants and meat.
Some went on four legs but could stand up and use their front ones to grasp.
Some went on two legs.
Their arms were not much help, but their jaws were strong.
We can guess at the way that they lived from their body parts.
Give a roar for dinosaurs!
They all fill us with awe.
Roar! Dinosaurs!
We have learnt a lot from fossils.
They have helped us to guess at the ways that different dinosaurs acted.
The more fossils that we find, the more accurate our thinking becomes.
We live in an amazing time for fossil hunting.
There has been a big boom in our understanding of dinosaurs and the ways that they led their lives.
We can also connect the ways that animals live today with the bodies of dinosaurs to pinpoint how they might have lived.
We have found out that some dinosaurs lived and hunted in packs.
We can tell this because we have found nests full of bones from different individuals but the same type of dinosaur.
They may have worked together the way that predators like hyenas do.
Some preferred to hunt alone.
We can get clues from a dinosaur's teeth and bones about what sort of diet they had.
Carnivores mouths are full of teeth that rip and tear.
They don't need any of the flat, grinding teeth that herbivores use to chew on plants.
The colour of a dinosaur's skin is something that we have guessed at.
This is because of how fossils form and how different parts of the body rot over time.
Dinosaurs lived such a long time ago.
Not all of them became fossils.
We have found impressions of skin but no actual skin samples.
We used to think that theropod dinosaurs looked like this.
However, we now understand that dinosaurs like T rex and velociraptor had feathers.
We can tell this from a line around their bodies in fossils where the feathers rotted away.
Theropod dinosaurs got smaller over time and started to be able to fly.
Over millions of years, they evolved into birds.
Even chickens come from dinosaurs!
We can even get a sense of how some dinosaurs raised their young.
Animals today vary a lot when it comes to looking after their babies.
It was no different for the dinosaurs.
We understand more about how plant eating dinosaurs raised their young because there were a lot of them.
From a dinosaur's bones, we can make some educated guesses about the way that it moved.
We can do this from clues in the bones with regard to how much weight they could hold on their limbs and also from footprints that have been preserved.
Some were able to walk on all four legs or stand up on their hind legs and use their front legs to manipulate objects.
They could have grasped things.
They could have defended themselves.
It would have been very useful.
Some dinosaurs had funny parts, like the short arms on a T rex.
For a while we thought that these limbs were vestigial, which means that they were of less and less use over time as this animal evolved.
However, these arms still helped T rex to cling onto prey and mates to some degree.
We need to remember that our understanding of dinosaurs is always changing.
The more research that we do and fossils that we find, the more we can confirm different theories that have been put forward.
It is so cool to live in the best time so far to understand dinosaurs!
Give a roar for dinosaurs!
They were such amazing creatures, and an important part of our planet's history.
Learning about dinosaurs is not just fun, it also helps us to advance the way that we understand evolution and the ways that our world changes.
The sun is up. The dog is up.
Mum is off.
Jump! The dog is off.
A big pal and a pup! It is fun.
A man! Jump!
A yip?
It lands in the yard.
The pup yips. The dog barks.
Jump! The dog is off.
It is mum!
Tug of war!
The dog must nap. It had the best day.
The sun is up. It is time to start the day.
The dog looks out of the window.
What is he going to do when his mum goes to work?
He could stay in his kennel all day, but that sounds kind of boring.
He will wait until his mum is gone.
Then he will be able to get up to some fun.
When her car is gone, he jumps up and propels himself over the fence.
He is going to see if there is any fun to be had in the next yard over.
Yes! Two of his pals are in the yard.
They often play when they are at the dog park or on walks.
The three of them run around the yard.
They bow down and wag their tails.
Their dad comes out to check on them.
The dog propels himself into the next yard.
He has gone still.
That means that he has spotted something.
He lifts an ear. What can he hear?
Over the fence and onto the grass.
He will find his next bit of fun for the day.
He leaps over the flowers.
It is the lady that lives a few doors down.
He has met her and her tiny, yellow dog before.
The lady likes it when he sings.
He revels in the chance to show off.
Oh!
He heard the sound of his mum's car coming down the street!
He had better get back home before she sees that he is gone.
Mum getting home is the best time of the day.
She always gives him a pat and plays with him.
Then they have dinner.
She has a new rope toy for him!
They play tug of war with the new toy until he starts to get tired.
Then they eat their dinner and it is time for bed.
What a day he has had! Time to sleep.
He curls up on the couch.
I wonder what he is going to get up to when the sun is up again?
Ted is the new kid on the block. He is mean.
He has a slingshot so that he can pelt us with rocks and bits of trash.
We try to steer clear of him, but sometimes it can't be helped.
Ted comes up to us while we are just having fun at the park.
His house is near the park, so he can see when we are there.
It used to be our favourite spot.
Now it is hard to enjoy it.
Mum has a chat to us.
She tells us that kids like Ted just need friends to treat them well.
She says that if we ask him to be a part of games, he will start to be nice to us.
We give it a shot, but it does not work.
Ted likes it when we are upset.
He likes to stand at the top of the slide so that he can stop us from having fun.
He leans on the swings to do the same thing.
We don't go to the swings because we know that he will fling stuff at us with his slingshot.
He does not use the swings.
He just likes to stop us from having a good time.
When we try not to pay him any mind, he still finds a way to make us upset.
We want to do something to teach him a lesson.
We start to think of a plan to get him back.
We go home and put red dots on ourselves.
They make us look like we are sick.
It will seem like we can spread it to kids who are near us.
When we get to the park and Ted spots the dots, he gets a fright.
He gets more of a fright than we thought he would get!
He asks what we have.
We say that the nurse told us it was a new kind of sickness.
It can spread in a flash and turn kids to goo!
Ted's jaw drops.
We start to chase him.
Ted runs so fast that his hat falls off.
He does not stop to grab it.
He runs all the way home.
He yells about the red dots and goo.
Our plan worked!
We can play for the rest of the day without Ted around.
Our plan worked a treat!
This is Skel.
He has wanted to have a pet by his side for a long time.
He figured that a dog would be an excellent thing to being with him when he gets out hunting with his crossbow.
But there is one problem.
Dogs love bones.
He did not think about that at first.
He got his new dog some bones as a treat and it was love at first sight.
But now he has a big problem on his hands.
One morning when Skel woke up, he could not get out of bed.
He soon realised that both of his arms had been popped off.
His dog was sitting on its bed next to him with a very guilty face.
Skel found the bones beside the dog bowl.
He found it pretty funny.
He told his dog that he can't do that again and then gave him some chicken.
Oh no, he will think that is a treat!
That's not a good message to send.
Skel felt like it would be fine.
He named his dog Bones because he loves them so much.
Skel and Bones went out on their first hunt together.
Skel decided to take a practice shot.
He raised his crossbow and aimed.
Then, pop!
Bones took Skel's leg and dashed off across the field.
Skel tried to catch Bones, but it was very difficult when he only had one leg to hop on.
Eventually he caught up to Bones.
Maybe this was going to be more of a problem than he thought.
The worst time was when Bones managed to steal Skel's skull.
It took forever to find it because he could not see where he was going.
After mistaking several things for his head, including a pumpkin and a watermelon, he eventually found his skull and attached it back on to his body.
Skel was not in the best mood.
He loved Bones and wanted to keep him, but it was not going to work if Bones kept taking bits of him and running off with them.
He would have to do a better job of training Bones so that both of them could live together in peace.
Skel spent a long time training Bones.
They worked on his behaviour for weeks and weeks.
When Bones did not do the right thing, Skel would tell him no in a deep voice.
Bones came to understand the word and what it meant.
When Bones was good, he got treats.
Bones puts his head to one side when he is listening to what Skel had to say.
Now Skel can put a bone on the ground and Bones will not take it.
Skel is very proud of how far Bones has come.
Skel has taught Bones to play with sticks instead.
Sticks are easy to come by, and there is no danger of Skel losing an arm or a leg.
Well done, Skel!
You trained him to not steal your bones anymore.
It will be easier to train him to do other things now.
Maybe you should start with telling him where to poop.
For now, it is time for cleanup duty.
The internet is like a web.
We use the web for both work tasks and fun.
The web has films, tunes and sites that we can use.
These kids want to learn.
Miss will help the kids use the internet.
The cord that plugs in the wall back there lets Miss use the internet.
We have the internet at home as well.
We must use the internet for most jobs.
Some like to post from wild spots!
The internet helps us to find art.
We can use it to find facts.
We live in the age of the internet.
Do you use the internet?
The internet goes all over the world.
We use it for all parts of life.
There are a lot of fun things to do on the internet, but we use it for work as well.
The internet is full of sites.
Some sites just have text.
Some have games, songs and things that we can watch.
She will teach her class how to use the internet.
It is a skill that they will need.
The internet might seem a bit much at first, but you can learn how to use it in a safe way.
You can use the internet to send mail.
It gets to people so fast!
We can get tasks done with speed and ease on the internet.
We can use it high and low to share cool things that we do.
We can have fun with friends and keep fit.
It is a great tool for bright minds that want to learn facts.
The internet can help us to talk to each other day and night.
We can use the internet to do great things for the world.
The internet is like a web that goes all over the world.
It helps us to connect with each other.
It lets us send messages and media to friends, family and colleagues in an instant.
This has changed a lot about the ways that we interact with each other.
Like all technology, the internet can be used in good and bad ways.
It is like having a superpower.
We need to make sure that we use the internet in safe and responsible ways so that we are using it to make our lives better.
We talk about the internet like a web because of how things on the internet are linked.
One page connects to others and it helps us to navigate our way through that website.
A page can have a variety of media on it such as text, pictures, music and videos.
This teacher is helping her class understand the internet and making sure that they will be able to use it in safe ways.
Some people on the internet try to send bad things like viruses to your computer.
You also should not talk to people on the internet that you do not know.
When you know how to use the internet in ways that are smart and safe, it is a brilliant tool.
With the click of a button, you can learn amazing things about different countries, animals and planets.
You can have almost any question answered in moments.
The internet makes it so that most information is freely available to anybody with a connection.
Researching for an assignment is a lot quicker than it used to be.
Still, there are some sources that are not as good as others.
Part of learning how to use the internet is being able to tell which sites have information that you can trust.
The internet has helped us to be much more aware of things that are happening in the world.
Before, we mainly got this information through newspapers and news programmes.
Now we can get this information quickly and from different sources.
We can also share in the amazing moments that people post when they do impressive things.
There are different apps that people use to share their achievements and raise our awareness about different problems in society that we can fix together.
The internet has also changed the way that people make and share things in the arts.
It is now much more possible for people to have their own podcasts and channels.
They can get their drawings, music, films, games and thoughts out there.
They do not need big companies to give them their approval.
Another part of learning how to use the internet is understanding how search terms work.
You need to develop the skill of being able to think about the question that you have and the most important words in it.
If the results of your search are too broad, you must learn how to narrow them down so that you can find the information that you are looking for.
The internet has also changed the way that we do business.
We are able to make trades and agreements between people in different countries very quickly.
This has made a lot of products available all over the world that were not so easy to access before.
Think of how easy it is now to order a book from another country.
The internet has changed the way that the whole world works.
We can all make sure that we are using the internet for good.
By making sure that we are using the internet in a safe way, we can engage with art, science and modern issues.
We can use the internet as a tool for fun and work in positive ways that help the whole world.
Sam was a lot of fun.
But a monster got him.
Sam got sad. He is in bed a lot.
I want to help. He tells me to quit it.
He does not want to be with Mum and Dad.
He is not Sam at all.
Nan and Pop try as well. It does not work.
So I tell Sam I miss him. It works.
He has a talk to Mum. She had a monster as a kid.
Sam talks to a doctor. She can help.
Sam has to work on it. It is a bit hard.
It is not a quick fix.
The monster will still be by him for a bit.
But my Sam is back.
Sam and I used to play a lot of games.
We spent so much time having fun.
But then a monster got him.
It was like a thief that stole Sam.
He did not care about a lot of things.
Most of the time, Sam just wanted to be in bed.
He looked fried all of the time.
I tried to help. He did not want to talk about it.
He said he was fine.
He did not want to eat.
He did not want to talk to Mum or Dad.
He just wanted to mope.
It felt like he was not Sam at all.
I missed the old Sam.
I spied on him when Nan and Pop gave things a try.
Sam sat by them, but he was in his own world.
I told Sam that I miss him.
That made him want to try to fix things.
Sam has a chat with Mum.
She had a monster that gave her grief when she was a teen.
She gets how it feels.
We find a doctor for Sam to talk to.
The doctor helps him to shift the way that he thinks.
It is not a quick fix.
Sam has to do a lot of hard work.
The monster does not want to go.
The monster is still there, but Sam is doing great work!
We help him where we can.
I am so glad to have my Sam back.
My brother and I used to play a lot.
We would make up worlds and games.
We would run around the house and the yard.
There was no monster that we could not slay and no riches we could not win.
But then a new monster came. It got Sam.
It is like he does not care about games and fun.
He walks around all day in a fog.
He is not himself.
Sam sleeps a lot. The monster taxes his health.
He does not look after himself like he used to.
It makes me mad that he does not want to play.
All he wants to do is lie in bed and mope.
Some days he will not move from his room.
I yell at him. Sam does not want to hear it.
He does not care that I am upset.
The monster is like a dark cloud that has come over him.
It is a fog that stops us from getting in.
It leaches him of the things that make him Sam.
Mum makes some of his favourite food.
He does not want to eat it. That makes me sad.
Sam loves his food.
He does not want to talk with Mum or Dad.
He does not want to hear their jokes and tales.
Sam is not himself at all.
The monster has changed him.
My wishes are doing no good.
I keep trying to think of ways that we can slay it, but nothing seems to work on this monster.
It is so strong.
Nan and Pop try as well. Nan tries to lift him up.
She tells him how proud she is of him.
Pop tries to understand. He fusses over him.
He says that Sam can call him at all hours of the day and night.
Sam does not want to talk to Nan or Pop.
He just sits there until they say that he can go to his room if he wants to.
I want to try one more thing.
I tell Sam that I miss him.
When I say that, there is a change in his eyes.
It is like they have more life than they have in a while.
I can see that I have gotten through the fog.
He says that he will talk to Mum.
Mum had a monster when she was a kid. She gets it.
She says that she does not want to push Sam before he wants to work on things.
He says that he wants to try.
Mum has a look around for a doctor that will be able to help Sam feel like his old self.
Now, Sam goes to see the doctor each week.
She talks to him and helps him to change the way that he thinks.
He opens up to her and speaks about what is going on for him.
Even just talking to her feels like it is helping.
She tells him that we need to look after our mind like we look after our body.
Sam still has a lot of work ahead of him.
It is no quick fix to change the way that you think.
The monster will not go away so easily.
It is fighting to stay.
But now, Sam knows how he can slay the monster bit by bit.
I can see it working.
The monster will still be here sometimes, but it is like we have our old Sam back.
Mum, Dad, and I do what we can to help Sam through.
We can slay any monster that comes our way.
Diya likes butterflies.
She helps them if they get in a bad spot.
She is shy in class. They are at the park.
The park has a lot of butterflies.
The plants make the butterflies come.
Diya wants to tell the class some facts.
Butterflies have six legs and four wings.
Miss is glad. Diya does not talk a lot in class.
She tells them more. Caterpillars come from eggs.
They turn into butterflies.
The caterpillar eats a lot.
It makes a pod and turns into a butterfly.

It makes her sad when plants and grass are taken away.
Then the butterflies do not have a nice place to live.
Diya is very shy in class.
She has a mental block when she tries to talk to other kids.
Today they are going to the park.
There are a lot of plants at the park.
Butterflies drink the nectar in flowers, so they are all over!
There are so many different kinds of butterflies.
They have different colours and patterns on their wings.
Diya knows some of their names.
Her mum and dad have given her a lot of books about butterflies.
Miss starts to tell them about the different butterflies.
Diya puts her hand up. Miss is a little surprised.
Diya never wants to talk in class.
Now she seems like she has to share!
Butterflies have a long, slender body.
They have six thin legs.
They also have four wings.
Two feelers come up out of their head.
They help the butterflies to sense things about the world.
Miss is impressed.
Diya knows quite a lot about butterflies.
Miss asks her to keep sharing.
She can see that this might be a good way for Diya to open up to the other kids in the class.
Diya talks about how she won a medal for a poster that she drew for her local bookshop.
They had to show the life cycle of an animal.
She found butterflies laying eggs and watched so that she could draw them.
Caterpillars came out of the eggs.
They ate a lot for a couple of weeks.
Then they made a cocoon around themselves.
A few weeks later, butterflies broke out!
Diya makes a new friend in class. Her name is Liz.
Diya and Liz want to know what the butterflies are thinking.
They start to guess.
They say the words that they think the butterflies would if they could talk.
Just after lunch, a whole swarm of butterflies comes to the park.
Diya knows what kind they are.
They are blue tigers.
They try to count their total, but there are too many.
The other kids gather around as Diya starts to tell a butterfly story.
She makes it up on the spot.
They think it is great!
Diya had such a great time in the park.
She is going to get good marks for the day.
She feels a lot better about school and the kids in her class now.
She thanks the butterflies for all that they did for her.
The bird has a nest.
It sits on the nest.
It has not fed.
The bird has left the nest.
A dog!
The dog gets to the nest.
The bird is sad.
A chick!
Can the dog help?
The dog ran off!
The bird is back.
The bird can help her chicks.
This bird has some eggs. She has kept them warm.
The chicks will hatch soon.
She sits on the eggs.
She has been on them for weeks.
It has not been fun, but it will be worth it.
Oh! A bug!
She has not had a bite to eat for a while.
She takes a stroll.
The eggs will be fine for a bit.
Oh no ... a dog! What will the dog do?
Will she eat an egg?
The bird is back. It spots the dog. Oh no!
The dog is by the nest.
The bird wants to stop the dog. She frets.
The dog is big.
Oh! The chicks come out of the eggs.
The chicks think that the dog is their mum!
It spooks the dog.
This dog does not look like it wants to be a bird mum.
The dog scoots off. The chicks try to go with her.
The bird lands. Her mood lifts.
She calls to the chicks.
Yes, this is mum. The chicks go in for a hug.
This bird has been on her nest for weeks.
It is almost time for the eggs to hatch.
She can hear sounds inside of the eggs.
It might only be a day or so.
Then she will have a lot of running around to do.
Chicks need a lot of care, but she is ready to be a great mum.
She will have to catch food for them and keep them warm.
She has not eaten for a long time.
A butterfly floats by.
She needs to eat so that she can look after her chicks when they hatch.
With no food, she will have no energy to run around after them.
The butterfly is far off.
She goes for a quick walk so that she can catch some bugs.
The bugs will fill her up and get her body back in good shape.
She spots some juicy worms in the grass.
They taste great.
Oh no.
The bird covered the nest with leaves, but a dog has found it.
A dog is not evil, but it can do bad things.
It might bite or crush one of the eggs while it is having a look.
Will the bird be able to get back in time to defend the nest?
She is close, but she does not know if she can land.
She is scared of the dog.
She is going to watch and see what it does.
She will swoop if it gets too close.
Her heart feels as heavy as an anvil.
Why did she leave?
She is so worried that she is going to lose an egg, but the dog is so big.
She might get hurt.
Oh no! The chicks have started to hatch.
The dog looks shocked.
It does not know where the chick came from.
The dog is not hurting the chick, it just wants to see what the chick is.
The chicks think that the dog is their mum!
They start to climb all over the dog.
They want food. The dog is so confused.
It does not want to be a bird mum.
The dog takes off. It thinks that it is in peril.
It can run a lot faster than the chicks.
They try to keep up, but it is out of sight before they know it.
The chicks feel all alone.
But then their mum lands.
She meets them for the first time.
The chicks are confused. They do not know her yet.
Is this the right mum?
Yes, this feels right.
This mum will help them get food and keep them warm.
They will be good pupils as she teaches them all that they need to know.
The bird is so glad that all of her chicks are safe.
Snap wants to go on a quest.
Her mum tells her to be smart but have fun.
Snap sets off. She zigs and zags.
She swims far.
It is all a ball!
She is full of zest. She does a jump and a flex.
She finds pals.
It is a wild quest.
But at the end, she wants to go back.
Snap swims and swims.
She gets back to her land .
and back to her mum.
Snap chats to her pop. She wants to go on a quest.
He went on a quest as a small croc.
She chats to her mum as well.
Her mum tells her to be smart but have fun.
She jumps in the river and starts to head off to the sea.
She will find a new place.
Snap swims for days.
Then she starts to see sights.
There are new plants and fish.
Each way she turns she is in awe.
It all fills her with joy.
Snap does a few loops in the sea.
It is a great place to swim.
She chats to animals that she has not seen in her whole life.
One of them leaps in the air. She loves the view.
Her quest was fun, but now Snap starts to miss home.
She heads back to the river that she took to this new place.
When she gets there, the view makes her sigh.
The old things can make you feel good too.
Best of all is when she spots her mum.
They sit on the bank as the dew sets in.
It is good to be home.
Snap had a chat with her pop.
She wants to go on a quest to find new things.
Her pop went on big trips when he was young.
He thinks it is a great move.
Snap will learn a lot about the world.
Snap talks to her mum about the trip.
She is a bit worried, but she knows that Snap will be smart.
Snap is a championship swimmer.
She also knows that Snap is getting to be a big croc and will do things her own way.
Off she goes!
Snap heads down the river that is next to her home.
She has been down this way with her family many times.
Soon the river spills out into the sea.
She has never gone past that point.
Snap swims for weeks until she gets to a new place.
There are plants and animals that she has never seen.
There are new fish to taste.
Snap swims about trying to take in all of the new sights and sounds.
The small things are fun as well!
The snails have different shells and the trunks of the trees are different colours.
Snap flits to and fro.
She asks a lot of questions and makes new friendships.
Sometimes she is so full of energy that she feels the need to do flips in the water.
She dives down, spins around and then launches up into the starry sky.
One of her favourite friendships was with an otter.
He floated on his back while he read books about the stars.
He told Snap about their names and how they are big balls of gas in space.
Snap had a great friendship with a dolphin.
She could launch out of the water so high!
Snap was in awe of her skills.
She loved to watch the dolphin leap out of the water when the moon was full and bright.
There were a lot of good parts to the trip, but there were some hardships as well.
Sometimes Snap got lonely.
Sometimes she felt homesick.
It was fun being around new things all of the time, but she started to miss things that she knew well.
When Snap felt that she was done for one trip, she started back for home.
She had a lot of great tales to tell her friends and family.
And she can take a trip again any time that she likes.
Snap gets back home.
It all looks like it did when she left it.
Even the sea snakes make her feel at home.
The trip was fun, but she has a special relationship with her homeland.
She also has a special relationship with her mum.
Snap's mum is so glad to have her home again.
She asks all about the trip.
It was all that Snap wanted.
Long ago, there was a princess that lived in a tall tower.
A dragon kept her there.
He was a blight on the land.
At night, her song came on the wind.
The town wanted to help, but a lot of them had been killed by the dragon.
One day, a man came. He could fight.
The town asked him to fight the dragon and set the princess free.
The man rode to the tower.
The dragon was having a nap.
The man went to cut off one of its heads.
But then... Oi!. It was the princess.
The dragon woke up. The man got a fright.
It went up to the princess. She got on his back.
The princess and the dragon went up in the sky.
It did not try to hurt her.
It did what she told it to.
They came in to land.
The dragon made sure to show off its smoke and jaws.
The princess could see that the man felt bad.
He had just heard the tall tales from the town.
He asked if he could do jobs to make it up to the princess.
She said yes.
There was a big pile of poop from the dragon at the foot of the tower.
The man got a spade.
The man did not mind the job.
It was fun to see the princess play with her dragon.
He stayed on to help the princess with odd jobs.
The dragon came to like the man a lot.
Now the man, the princess and the dragon all live in the tower.
They are glad to be far from the town and its tall tales.
Pat wants to see where pee and poop go.
Down the pipe.
Pat finds a pipe rat.
Pat must wash off.
A big pond. A grate gets the big bits of junk.
The pipe rat takes Pat to the next part.
The tanks all have jobs.
Some parts of the job take time.
They get rid of the waste.
The water that comes out will not hurt us.
It is safe to put in the sea.
Pat is back!
Pat the rat wants to know, where does pee and poop go?
Down the pipe.
He will get the scoop on pee and poop.
Pat finds a pipe rat. It knows where to go.
Pat gets soap on him. He must wash off.
The pipes send the water to a big pond.
The gloop is thick.
A grate gets the big bits of junk.
The water goes on.
The pipe rat takes Pat to the next part.
The tanks all have jobs.
This one sprays the water on stuff that sucks up the bad bits.
Some parts of the job take time.
The big bits of filth sink to the base of this tank.
Then the water goes on.
The waste will get put on crops that we will eat as food, so it must not make us sick.
The water that comes out will not hurt plants or animals.
At the end, the water is safe to go into the sea.
Pat is back! And he knows where pee and poop go.
Pat the rat wants to know, where does pee and poop go?
He cannot read about wastewater, so there is only one way to find out.
Pat the rat takes a dive into the toilet so that he can ride the water down the pipes.
Some people put things in the water and should not be there.
What will happen to these things along the way?
How does wastewater get cleaned so that it is safe for plants and animals?
Pat the rat is ready to learn about wastewater treatment.
Pat runs down a pipe.
He meets a sewer rat at the other end.
Pat has spent his whole life in a house.
He does not know about the sewer.
His new friend says that he will show Pat where the pee and poop go.
Pat gets some soap on him.
The sewer rat tells him to wash himself off.
He does not want Pat to get hurt by any of the muck that flows along with the wastewater.
Here is the first way that the junk is sorted.
The big bits of trash get stuck on a grate.
A man rakes the big bits so that they can be taken to the dump.
The water still has small bits of junk in it, so it flows on.
Pat and the pipe rat run to the next part of the treatment.
Pat is having a good time.
He asks the pipe rat things as they go so that he can understand all that there is to know about wastewater.
The tanks all have jobs.
Here is where the water is sprayed over a material that will soak up some of the bad bits.
The water that comes out the other end will be a lot cleaner.
Wastewater treatment needs to be done in stages.
Each stage takes out different bits until the water is clean enough to put out into the environment.
Some parts of the jobs take time.
In this tank the water settles.
The heavy bits sink to the bottom and are drained off.
The water is looking much cleaner now, but it is not ready to drink or put out into the environment.
There are small things that we cannot see that are bad for us.
The waste will get used on farms, so it must not make us sick.
It might seem gross that this is how waste is used, but poop is very good for making plants grow.
We know how to use it so that it does not do any harm to our bodies when we eat the plants.
This saves on making fertiliser and puts the waste to good use.
The last part of the treatment is to disinfect it with chemicals or UV light.
After this is done, the water is safe to drink.
It is also safe to send out into the environment.
This water will not cause problems for fish and other animals living around that water or the plants that grow there.
At the end, the water is safe to go into the sea.
It gets released so that it can be a part of the water cycle again.
By treating water and releasing it, we can have less of an impact on the water cycle while we still get all of the water that we need for drinking, bathing and cleaning.
The pipe leads all the way to the sea.
Pat the rat pops out.
His family are having a day at the sea! What luck.
Pat the rat wishes that he could tell them all about what he has learned.
Maybe one day they will take their own trip to the wastewater treatment plant to get the scoop on pee and poop.
This kitten has a pup as a pal. They like to play.
Thump! This kitten lands on its back for a nap.
This kitten has plain, white fur with two black stripes on the top.
Five kittens in the park.
There is a lot of room for them to run and jump.
Thud! What was that? The kitten got a scare.
It may go for the bug.
Kitten, bowls are for food! They are not for naps.
This kitten can spy a fly.
Soon it will jump and try to grab it.
A mum and her kittens.
She licks them to keep them clean.
A kitten in the yard. What can it spy?
I hope it does not go for the bee!
A kitten up high.
It is so small that it can fit in a hand!
No rain.
This kitten gets to play in the yard for a bit.
It went up the bark.
Some day, kittens will be cats and not play as much.
But they still give us a lot of love.
Once upon a time, there was a princess.
She had long, brown hair and lived in a tower that touched the sky.
Every night, nearby towns would hear her sweet singing carry on the breeze.
The people of the town could not talk to the princess as she was held in her tower dragon.
The beast had two heads, each as terrible as the other.
It gobbled men up for sport.
None of the townsfolk felt like being the next dragon fodder, so the princess remained in the tower with the creature keeping watch.
The townsfolk would hear her singing and think on how frightened and alone she must feel.
One day a brave and handsome knight came riding by.
He was tall, strong, and had a sword with a sharp blade.
He heard about the dragon and the princess, and knew that he must slay the beast and rescue her.
That night, he heard her song on the breeze.
Do not fear, he said back to the song as he got ready for the battle.
Soon you will be free of that terror.
The knight woke with the sun and put on his shining armour.
He rode out to the tower, and saw the sleeping dragon coiled around it.
He held out his sword and rode forth.
Oi! somebody yelled from the top of the tower.
The knight pulled on the straps of his horse.
He looked up and saw the princess scowling down at him.
Just what do you think you are doing?
the princess yelled.
Saving you from this foul beast, the knight said.
The princess whistled down at the dragon.
It put its tail up to her window.
She slid down its spine with ease and sat at the base of its neck.
Its two heads looked at her with grins, and she gave them a scratch.
What is it about knights and always having to rescue or kill something?
the princess said with a frown.
This "foul beast" keeps me safe from all the awful gawking townsfolk.
I would not get a moment’s peace if he did not gobble them up.
The knight was not sure what to say.
He sat there on his horse looking quite baffled.
He watched as the princess flew up into the sky and did loops on the back of her dragon.
They flew low over the land, making trees bend and rivers curl up under the dragon’s belly.
When she was done, she landed the dragon at the knights feet.
The dragon snarled at him.
One of its heads had curls of smoke coming outs of its nostrils, and the other bore its long, jagged teeth.
He put away his sword and the dragon closed its mouths.
You see? the princess said. The knight nodded.
If you do not need saving from this… peaceful creature, the knight said with a frown, there must be some way that I can help.
Some way to make it up to you.
As a matter of fact, there is, the princess said, smiling down at the knight.
He got off his horse and knelt down at the princess’s feet.
Just say the task and it will be done, he said.
The princess tilted her head to the side.
He looked over and saw a huge pile of dung at the bottom of her tower.
The knight took off his armour and started to shovel.
All the while the princess played with her dragon, getting him to sit and fetch, and telling the heads that they were very good boys indeed.
The princess and the dragon were pleased with the knight's work, and the he stayed on to help the princess with her pet.
He took the dragon for walks every day, and scratched its belly when it was sleepy.
Now the townsfolk tell the story of the weak knight that was tricked by the dragon in his attempt to rescue the princess.
They say that he is a slave to the dragon, but nobody much feels like taking a closer look and being the next dragon fodder.
And so, the princess, the knight, and the dragon live a happy life free from the horrible townsfolk and their tall tales.
Once upon a time, there was a princess that lived in a castle.
The princess loved to sing.
Every night her song would float down from her tower and across to the nearby town.
The people of the town loved the princess singing.
She was quite the musician.
But there is a sad part to the tale.
The princess was being held captive by a vicious dragon.
All those who tried to rescue the princess met a grizzly death by one of its heads.
This put horrifying thoughts in the heads of the townsfolk, and no more of them could bring themselves to try to save her.
The townsfolk were filled with sorrow.
If only there was a way that they could help their fair princess.
But those who remained were too young or old to attempt to rescue her.
They would be little more than a sacrificial offering to the dragon.
One day, a brave knight came to town.
His armour was strong and his horse was fast.
He heard the story of the princess and the dragon from the townsfolk and felt the need to help.
He said that he was the best with a sword in all the land!
Most of the time the knight would want a reward for such a task, but he was willing to undertake this one for free.
The gratitude of the town would be enough.
The knight rode out to the tower.
He found the beast sleeping at its base.
The two heads were as fearsome as those in the town had said.
He drew his sword and got ready to slay the beast.
Oi! somebody yelled from the top of the tower.
Just what do you think you're doing?
The knight looked up. It was the princess.
Saving you from this beast, he said.
The dragon awoke and rose to the top of the tower.
The princess jumped out of the window and landed on the dragon's back.
She was glowering down at the knight.
He could not put any of it together.
This "beast" is the only thing that keeps those horrid townsfolk away, said the princess.
They tell very tall tales and spend all of their time on nonsense gossip.
The knight watched as the princess and the dragon flew around the field.
She had trained it very well.
They did tight turns around the trees and pulled up out of a dive just before the surface of the water.
The knight was very impressed.
The dragon landed.
It puffed smoke out of its noses and threatened the knight with its jaws.
The knight soon realised that he was no match for the dragon.
He got off his horse and put down his sword.
He felt awful.
He wanted to do something for the princess and the dragon as a form of apology.
The princess thought for a moment before smirking.
If you are willing to trade your sword for a shovel, there is a huge pile of poop at the base of the tower that is getting a bit smelly.
The knight took off his shining armour and let his horse off to graze in the field.
Then he got to his task.
As the knight worked, the princess played with her dragon.
When the heads did what she wanted, she praised them.
She had taught the dragon to do a new trick while the knight was at work.
The knight ended up staying on with the princess and the dragon.
He took on a lot of duties, like scratching the dragon's belly as it fell asleep.
He was like a magician when the dragon had an upset tummy.
Soon the dragon loved him as much as it loved the princess.
Now the people in the town tell the story of the weak knight that went off to save the princess and failed.
They shake their heads about how slow his horse was and how he lacked in bravery.
But over by the tower, the knight, the princess and the dragon live happily away from the townsfolk and their tall tales.
This is Callum.
Callum drives cars.
Callum wins a lot!
He thinks cars are the best.
He wants to make his best car yet.
He gets all of the bits to make it.
He puts a bolt on the side.
Callum is off! He is tenth. Then fifth. Then.
Callum wins! His mum and dad saw it all.
Here is a kitten with its pup friend.
They will be brought up side by side.
Some people think that cats and dogs always fight.
It is not so. They can be good mates.
This kitten has stretched out for a nap.
Cats sleep a lot and kittens are only young.
That means that they need even more rest.
It is normal for kittens to sleep for about fifteen to twenty hours each day.
Big cats like lions sleep a lot too!
This kitten is very young.
It needs to be kept warm.
It has a warm, pink blanket.
At this age, the colour of their eyes change.
Here are some kittens in the park.
These kittens have come from the same litter.
They are not all the same colour, but they have the same patterns on their foreheads.
This kitten is a few months old now.
It is a bit frightened by the spider.
It does not know if it wants to chase it or hide.
It would be best to play with the ball of string instead.
A kitten in a bowl?
Cats and kittens find some funny spots to sleep.
This bowl looks like it is smooth.
It is just the right size for this little one.
This kitten can spy a fly.
Kittens think that flies are a lot of fun to chase because they are so quick.
They also like that they have to jump up to grab them.
These kittens were not born too long ago.
They still have their eyes closed.
Their mum needs to keep them clean and warm.
They are just on a diet of milk for now.
Meow!
There are a lot of smells out in the garden that a kitten can sniff out.
When a pet is young, all of the smells around them are new.
They want to check it all out.
This kitten is up high in her hands.
Kittens like to be up high, because it means that they can see a lot further.
They like to survey a room from a spot like this.
We cannot be fluent in cat language, but we can still tell what they want.
This one has climbed up a tree for the same reason.
Its claws are small but sharp.
They are perfect for gripping into the bark and shooting up the trunk.
Kittens are cats before long.
Most animals do not take as long to grow up as we do.
An adult cat might not play as much as a kitten, but they are just as full of love.
This is Zom. He is a zombie.
He has been eating brains all of his life.
His mum raised him on brains.
That is all he knows how to cook.
He is sick of eating brains.
Zom does not just want to mope about it.
He is going to take action.
He is going to try cooking with some different flavours.
It is time to go out and find ingredients.
Zom's emotions are high.
He has no idea what he is going to come across, but he is going to learn how to craft with it.
I am so glad for him!
There are so many things in this world that are better to eat than brains.
What is this that he has come across?
Is it an egg?
I do not think that I have ever seen a green egg before?
Oh!
It is a normal chicken egg but it has gone all rotten.
Zom, please put that down.
If you use that in a meal you are going to get a stomach ache.
You will have the most toxic farts all day.
It is truly a terrible idea to use that rotten egg in any sort of dish.
What is this that you have come across now?
Is that wheat?
Maybe it used to be wheat that could go into a lovely loaf of bread, but it is long past its expiration date.
It looks like it has been rained on and gone all mouldy.
Mould stinks something awful and is all furry.
You definitely do not want to be using that in your cooking.
Yuck.
I guess the wheat is coming with us as well, huh?
Well, as long as you don't want me to try any of the concoction that you are making then that is alright.
I do not think you will find anybody that wants to share this horrendous creation with you.
Come on, let us see what other ingredients we can find for this nightmare of a dish.
It looks like somebody dropped some sugar here a long time ago.
There are bugs all through it and it has been stepped in.
It is not my idea of a prime ingredient, but I think I know what is going to happen when Zom sets his eyes on this abomination.
Go on. Grab the sugar, Zom.
I can see that it fills you with delight.
At this point you may as well.
You are making a very adventurous dish indeed.
You may as well go all in.
I just hope that you are going to be able to eat it.
I will not even be able to handle the stench.
Is that the final ingredient in your hand?
What is that a pail of? Milk? Interesting.
It has gone all sour.
It is yellow and full of big, lumpy chunks.
I think that is the best option for an ingredient that will bind all of these things together.
People in this area sure leave a lot of waste about!
Yes, the pail of milk is the final ingredient.
Proceed with caution, Zom.
All of these things together could make the worst stink bomb that this world has ever seen.
Carefully carry all of the ingredients over to the crafting table and get to work.
Ok.
He has put in three portions of the horrid wheat, three pails of the stinky milk, two serves of the disgusting sugar and the foul, rotten egg in the middle to top it all off.
What do you think all of these ingredients are going to come together to make?
A cake!
This is the worst cake that I have ever seen, and it smells like death.
I am going to start taking some steps back now so that I do not spew everywhere.
Although, if I did, I am sure that Zom would use it as icing for his rank cake.
Still, I am impressed that he was able to make anything at all from those ingredients.
Well, he seems pleased with himself.
As gross as it is, the cake is definitely different to brains.
Enjoy your cake, Zom!
But please never invite me around for morning tea.
I do not think I could ever trust you as a chef again after what I have witnessed today.
Oh no... here comes the spew!
Zom likes to go out on walks.
You never know what you are going to come across when you set out on a hike.
Today he has found something very wild indeed.
It is a rainbow rabbit!
Now, Zom is not that knowledgeable on the subject of rabbits, but he does know that rabbits do not usually come in the rainbow variety.
Then he makes another amazing discovery.
The rabbit has rainbow milk!
Zom thinks that is absolutely marvellous.
He kneels down in the grass and gets some milk from the rabbit.
He thinks it tastes good.
Then he catches the rabbit. He has an idea!
Zom wants to have the source of the rainbow milk on tap.
Zom makes a little pen that he can house some rabbits in.
Then he goes all through the area and collects the rabbit eggs.
Even though the eggs all look the same, Zom is sure that there are going to be more rainbow rabbits about.
He starts to hatch them and finds that he gets a good number of multi coloured bunnies!
Zom sets that rabbits that are not rainbow coloured free.
Then he gets to work on collecting the rainbow milk.
What is he going to do with it all?
Is he going to use it to make art?
Does he want to do some experiments on it to see what gives the milk its colour?
Oh no, I think I know what he might have in store for us.
Yup. Zom has been baking again.
He has made cake pops. And, surprise!
They are rainbow coloured.
Well, I guess Zom is up to his old tricks.
But why does he need so many rabbits?
Surely, he is not going to eat that many cake pops by himself?
Oh no … he has made a bench.
Does he means to set up a shop?
He mixes and kneads for the rest of the day….
Yes. Here come the villagers.
They are thrilled about there being a shop close by.
They have never seen a cake pop before.
They cannot wait to buy them.
Zom will have his pockets lined with gold by the end of that day.
That is if the villagers like the taste of rabbit milk.
It seems that Zom has a knack for being a salesman.
The villagers have come in scores, and they have all bought cake pops!
They have also brought along their children.
The families are looking at the cute, little rainbow rabbits in the pen.
Do they realise what they are going to eat, or do they just like the look of the bunnies on show?
I do not think that they knew what the ingredients were.
Here comes the rainbow spew!
It is all down this villager’s front.
He is outraged that Zom would sell something with its base ingredient being so gross.
Zom does not think there is anything wrong with it.
He eats one to show that he loves his creation.
Now the villager children have started puking all over the field!
It will be covered in a sea of rainbow vomit before long.
The villagers drop the cake pops where they stand and start to run off towards home.
Zom yells that there will be no refunds.
The villagers do not care.
They just want the taste out of their mouths.
Zom is sad.
He tried something new, and everybody hated it.
His shop has failed. But wait … What is this?
Not everything has run away.
There is a dog in the field that is very much looking like it wants to try a rainbow cake pop.
Zom looks around for its owner, but he cannot see them.
The dog bites off a bit of the cake pop in Zom’s hand.
The dog loves it! He does not vomit everywhere.
He keeps licking at the cake pop and taking little bites.
Zom is delighted.
The villagers may not have liked his cake pops, but at least somebody did.
And there are a lot more cake pops where that came from!
Maybe the dog will be his friend?
A skeleton runs over to apologise.
His dog, Bones, ran off when he smelled something good over this way.
Zom smiles and offers the skeleton a cake pop.
The skeleton chomps down on the cake pop in glee and compliments Zom’s cooking skills.
Zom could not be happier.
He feels like Skel and Bones will be his best friends.
Skel loves being able to look after Starfang for Zom, but there is a bit of a problem.
Starfang is quite a large spider, and Skel already had Bones in the house.
That does not leave a lot of room for him.
Skel often has no room to move in the bed once the pets snuggle up to him.
They dont like their pet mat on the floor.
Zom has an idea.
He has a bit of knowledge when it comes to making houses, even though he has never made his own.
Zombies tend to roam free, which was the problem with Starfang in the first place.
He did not want to lose him.
Zom says that Skel can go on a trip while he works on making the house bigger.
Then they can both live in it and Skel will have plenty of room.
Skel loves the idea.
Zom starts right away.
He wants to keep the iconic, spooky look of Skel's house while still making it feel fresh and new.
He starts with the existing room.
That will now just be for the pets.
Zom has a lot of work ahead of him.
He redoes the walls and ceiling.
He changes the decor.
When he gets the feel right in the pets room, he will move on to expanding the rest of the house.
Zom has put up some things to make Starfang feel at home.
He has hung up bits of web all over the place.
He hopes that it will serve two purposes.
Firstly he wants Starfang to feel comfortable.
Secondly, the webs make it look super spooky!
He can see that the pets are a bit stressed.
He gets a spoiled potato for Starfang and a bone for Bones.
Uh oh… he must not know that Bones is not allowed that as a treat.
Starfang is not a fan of all of the changes and noises.
Zom starts on the hallway so that Starfang can hide in there while he is working on the pets’ room.
Starfang scuttles into a dark corner and hisses.
Zom is sure that he will love it when it is finished.
He just does not like it right now.
When he is finished with the pets room, Zom gets distracted and starts to work on the front area.
He wants Skel to get a big surprise when he first sees the house.
He decorates the front area with jack o lantern blocks, Ender dragon skulls and soul fires.
It is truly something to behold!
That says perfectly that this is a spooky adobe.
Zom has a real knack for this!
Skel is back from his trip. He is so thrilled!
He loves that Zom kept the feel of his house but made it fresh as well.
He can't wait to go inside.
Starfang is there when they open the door to come in and have a look.
He seems a bit more settled now.
Skel loves the entrance!
The bricks are all knobbly and rough.
It looks like a dungeon.
He has never been one for design.
His room before had been very simple.
He just loves what Zom has done with the place.
Skel looks so happy with the pets’ room.
Zom has made them a big bed that Bones and Starfang can sleep on together, since they do not seem to like sleeping on the floor.
Skel thinks that the little webs all about the place are a nice touch.
The soul torches look so much cooler than the old ones!
Bones jumps up on the bed.
He is so excited about the new room.
Skel sees the bone that Zom gave to him.
He tells Zom about not being able to give any bones to Bones.
Of course, thinks Zom.
They take the bone away and give Bones some meat instead.
Zom will not make that mistake again.
Starfang gets on the bed.
It is time to head to sleep for the night.
Bones jumps up there as well.
Skel sure is glad that he will not have to curl up with them anymore.
He is looking forward to his first night of good sleep in a long time!
Skel turns to the hallway to continue the tour of the rest of the house.
He knits his brow.
Zom the house is lovely.
But where is the rest of it? Oh no.
Zom spent such a long time making the pet's room and the entrance look nice that he did not get around to finishing the rest of the house!
Oh well.
It looks like they are going to have to bunk with the pets tonight.
Move over, Starfang!
Zom and Skel have a game that they like to play.
They point to the peak of a hill that is nearby and see who can run to the top first!
No flying is allowed.
This time they see a pig that is up super high!
They decide that the first to the pig wins.
Bones does not like running up hills.
He will stay in the field and look for stinky things to roll in.
Skel got there first!
He is the winner of the pig race.
What was a pig doing up so high?
Maybe it was looking for a truffle?
Skel keeps an eye out for Zom.
He wants to boast about how much faster he was.
But Zom never makes it to the top.
Soon Skel hears Zom call out to him to follow his voice.
Zom has found something. Is it a kind of treasure?
He looks pretty happy about it, that is for sure.
I know! Maybe it is something to eat?
Zom likes to eat all sorts of weird things.
I bet it is something horrid that he is going to gobble down with Skel.
Maybe they will even give a bit of whatever it is to Bones.
Yes, it is an egg. No wonder Zom was so excited.
Skel gets down the hill to where Zom is standing and looks into the little cavity in the dirt.
It is such an odd egg.
He has not seen one like it before.
Zom is keen to crack it open right now and drink the raw yolk to see what it tastes like.
Skel thinks that they should put the brakes on that.
If they have never seen an egg like this before, they should check around to see if it belongs to any animals.
First they try a hen.
It looks at them with a blank stare.
Skel thinks that they should leave it by the hen for a bit to see if it accepts the egg and sits on it.
The hen does not.
It starts to rain as they are watching to see what the hen does.
Zom begins to get grumpy.
He was already feeling hungry, now he was getting soaked through.
It is definitely not a hen egg.
Skel wonders whether it is a bird egg at all.
After all, there are a lot of different kinds of animals that lay eggs.
Since they are already wet, they go for a dive with the egg to see if any of the fish or squid seem to take a liking to it.
None of the creatures in the water pay any attention to them at all.
Dragons lay eggs as well.
They zoom up into the sky to see if they want to take custody of the egg.
The dragons just keep flying around, not paying them any mind either.
Zom thinks that they should be knighted for all of their efforts.
Then again, maybe Skel will let him eat the egg now that it does not belong to any animals.
Skel will still not let Zom eat the egg!
Skel feels like it might be from some unknown creature.
He wants to help it to hatch so that they can see what is growing inside.
Skel brings the egg to his house so that he can keep it warm by his bedside table.
The torches nearby will give it the warmth to keep developing and eventually hatch.
One day, Skel runs out to find Zom.
He tells him that the egg has hatched!
They head back to Skel's house.
When Skel opens the door, Zom sees a kind of creature that he has never laid eyes on before!
It is a huge spider with bizarre colours.
Zom and Skel feel like it comes from an unknown planet.
Zom loves it!
Bones is a bit scared of the spider.
He hides on the table.
Zom wants to pat the spider and bond with it.
Maybe it can be his pet?
He gets closer, but the spider runs into the corner of the room.
He kneels down next to it. It tries to hide.
Zom gets an idea of how he can gain the spiders trust.
He grabs an old potato out of his pocket.
It is spoiled. Will the spider really like it?
The spider loves the spoiled potato!
It starts to explore the room.
It even comes up next to Zom so that he can pat it.
It must be a very smart spider if it has understood Zom’s actions so quickly.
Bones is starting to come around to the spider.
He can see that Zom is not afraid, so it makes him feel more at ease as well.
Zom names the spider Starfang.
He wants to keep him as a pet, but he does not have a house.
He roams the land and is frightened that Starfang would wander off.
Skel says that he is happy to keep Starfang at his place with Bones.
Zom is very grateful.
He is also very happy that Skel did not let him eat the odd egg!
Book One The Machine.
The staircase creaked as the children walked up to the door.
Their prank did not seem so great now.
They had snipped the heads off a few roses in a flowerbed.
Now their parents had all said that they had to go around to the old lady's house in the afternoons.
They would have to do chores to make up for it.
The lady that opened the door was not like other ladies that they knew.
She had a nose that went to the side.
Bits of dust and bugs hung around her like a cloud.
Hello, dears, she said. My name is Mrs. Quigley.
I have tea and rock cakes set out for you, Mrs.
Quigley said.
The kids were confused.
They did not think she could be giving them tea and snacks.
They sat on the couch.
The house was a mess.
They felt a bit sorry for her, and really bad about cutting her roses.
The tea was lukewarm and the rock cakes too hard, but the children ate them.
At least she wasn't mad, Ada thought.
And now to your task, Mrs.
Quigley said with a grin.
Ada heard a plop as Skink lost her rock cake in her tea.
Tell me, do you like reading? Mrs. Quigley asked.
We don't like it much, Darren said.
Books are boring.
None of us read outside of what we have to for school.
Yeah, Skink said.
Why can't there be books that are for fun?
Well, it wasn't always like that, said Mrs.
Quigley. The older three started to feel ill.
They had heard about other books.
Books that had been burnt long ago. Had Mrs.
Quigley read one of the books that she was not meant to?
I have a few old books that I want you to read to me.
I'm too old now to get through them myself.
Lachlan frowned.
What are they about?
They are fiction, Mrs. Quigley said.
I thought that all of those books were long gone?
Darren asked. Most of them, Mrs Quigley said.
But my husband found me a few through his life.
He made me a machine to help me read them.
That is what you will use when you read for me.
We can read, Ada said.
I'm sure that you can read non fiction very well.
But reading fiction needs different skills, said Mrs.
Quigley.
I will give you some time to talk about it. Mrs.
Quigley left the room.
I don't know about this, Darren said.
Those books changed the way that people thought.
What do you think, Lachlan? Ada asked.
We always do stuff that we are not meant to.
This is no different, he said with a smirk. Skink?
Ada asked. They are just books.
How bad could they be? SKink said. Ada nodded. Ok.
We will give it a try.
The children walked down into the basement. Mrs.
Quigley took them over to a chest.
There were pictures of different animals all over it.
Mrs. Quigley gave Ada an old key.
Ada put the key in the lock and turned it.
The chest clicked open.
There were ten books inside.
Each one had a picture on the spine.
Pick any one you like, Mrs. Quigley said.
Ada reached out for one with a bird on it.
First you need to think of a character for yourself.
Ada, Darren, and Lachlan tried, but they couldn’t think of anybody else to be.
They chose themselves.
Skink wanted to be a lot of different animals and creatures.
Mrs.
Quigley said that she should be a shapeshifter so that she could change on the spot.
Skink thought that was perfect.
Then Mrs. Quigley took them over to the machine.
They stood still as Mrs.
Quigley put strange caps on their heads with tubes that lead to a tank.
Mrs.
Quigley put the book into the tank and it came to bits.
Then, everything went black.
Book Two The Bowerbird Blues.
Everything went black.
Then, fine lines started to appear until there was a whole world before them.
They saw a small town by a forest.
It seemed as real as the basement.
Darren, Lachlan and Skink all looked at Ada.
Well.
let’s head into that town and see what happens, she said.
They walked down the main street in town.
A policeman was walking up the other way.
He made his way over. He seemed so real.
You lot are new around here.
Yes, Sir, Ada said. The policeman frowned.
I won’t be harsh on you then, the policeman said, seeing that you do not know the rules.
You're going to have to give over a few things, the policeman said.
He pointed out Lachlan's shirt, Darren's laces, and a bracelet on Skink's arm.
All of them were blue.
I don't understand what we've done, Ada said.
Blue's bad news in this place, the policeman said.
It's gotten to a point where we can't allow it.
The policeman left. Ada saw a lady watching them.
She walked over to her.
Excuse me Miss, but can you tell us what that was about?
Ada asked. You put us in danger, the lady said.
What do you mean? Lachlan asked.
The blue calls to them.
The ones that bring the sadness. Look!
Here's one of them now! the lady yelled.
She pointed to a bird.
and then ran off.
Well, that did not help at all, Darren said, frowning.
I might have the answer, Skink said.
She took out a small, blue hair tie from her pocket.
Good job, Ada said with a wink.
They put the hair tie on the ground.
Before long, a bowerbird came.
I know about these, Darren said.
They take blue things to decorate their nests.
Skink, Ada said, you know what to do.
Skink focused on the bowerbird and started to transform.
Skin flew after the bird.
Then she led them to the nests.
At first, they thought Skink had taken them to the dump.
There was junk everywhere.
When they looked closer though, they saw that things had been used to make nests.
Lachlan pulled a few things out of the nests.
He found old pictures and a broken toy sword.
There were beads and pen lids and bits of cloth.
It all had blue paint on parts of it.
Sometimes they were small dabs.
What was that the lady said about something being called and bringing sadness?
Ada asked.
I think they have lost people.
They wanted something to take their sadness away.
But soon they started blaming the birds for the way that they feel.
Skink was looking at the things in the nest, keeping quiet.
She fluttered up to Lachlan’s shoulder.
I think I might have an idea, Lachlan said.
When our grandad died, dad would get really angry if anybody spoke about Grandad.
He put all of Grandad's things in the shed.
Lachlan picked up a toy.
But after a while be started to spend time in there with Grandad's things.
It helped.
They went back to town and got a group of people.
When they saw the old things, they began to smile.
A lot of time had passed.
They picked things up and held them.
Some took them home.
As they heard people sharing old stories, the four children saw the world was breaking up into lines and had less and less detail.
Soon it went dark.
Book Three The Min Min Lights.
The next afternoon, the children went straight to Mrs.
Quigleys house after school. Mrs.
Quigley smiled as she listened to the twists and turns that the story took.
I thought so, she said with a smile. Thought what?
Darren asked.
That even without training, reading stories is somehow a part of each and every one of us.
Are you ready for your next book? she asked.
They sat down on the couch.
The book that she chose was black this time, with an orb on it.
First the dark came, then the lines, then a small town of shabby houses and shops.
They looked like messes that had not been fixed up for years.
Skink looked around at the old paint jobs and window boxes full of dead plants.
It made her sad to see signs that this was a place that had been loved once.
It was late afternoon, but everybody was already shut up in their houses.
A man came out of his house and waved them over to his fence.
You shouldn’t be walking around like this, the man said.
Ada looked at the setting sun.
She knew that it was dangerous to walk around at night, but she’s never been told not to walk around in the afternoon.
You need to get inside and stay there until the morning.
Why? asked Ada. It’s not safe at night.
That’s when the min min lights come.
Darren’s ears pricked up. I know about those.
It's an old bush myth.
Don’t people follow them into the bush?
The man nodded. Yes, but it is not a myth.
My little girl went off with the lights years ago.
Please, stay safe.
The man got up and went back into his house.
We are not planning on... she started.
Oh yeah, Ada said with a grin.
How else will we find out what is going on?
If we had never gone looking for the bowerbird nest in the last book, the whole town would have stayed sad forever.
Ok, Skink said.
They walked away from the town and waited for dark.
Just as the man had said, orbs of light started to shine.
They followed them deeper and deeper into the bush.
So... I've been thinking, Darren said.
What happens if we can't read the book?
The four of them kept walking.
Anybody? Darren asked. Well, we don't know. Do we?
Ada said. That worries me, said Darren.
Lachlan frowned over at Darren as he tilted his head in Skink's direction.
What? Darren said. It does.
The lights got bigger and smaller, closer and further away.
There were also glowing mushrooms all through the forest.
Sometimes they seemed to switch off, like when a light bulb fizzes out.
Sometimes they followed the light from the mushrooms by and got all turned around until they found the lights again.
Ada had a great sense of direction, but she was less and less sure that she would be able to get them back to the town if she had to.
Finally, one was close enough that Ada could touch it.
When she did, she disappeared.
Skink held onto Lachlans hand as he and Darren touched the lights as well.
Ada was there again when they opened their eyes, but they seemed to be in the same place that they had started.
The children found their way back to town.
By then, it was morning. People were moving about.
They weren’t the people that had been peeking through the windows the day before, but they looked similar to some of them.
Could it be the lost family members?
Darren asked.
They walked to the house of the man they had spoken to the day before.
A young woman who was only a few years older than them came to the door.
She looked tired. I'm sorry, do I know you?
she asked. We know your father, Ada said.
The young woman started to cry.
Just then, a man in a uniform came up behind them.
Did you four just come from the forest?
They nodded.
We will have to find you a place to stay.
Why don't you go back to the old town?
There are people there that must be missing you.
We've tried, but we kept losing people.
We haven't had anybody new come through for years.
I think I could lead us back, she said.
Ada pitches ideas well.
The whole town went as a group.
Even if they did not get back to the old town, at least they would be together.
So that they wouldn't start to follow the mushrooms, Skink turned into an insect and glowed a bright blue.
She made soft buzzes to keep them on track.
Ada followed the min mins, Skink followed Ada and the people all trailed behind.
When they got back to the town that they were first in, people started coming out of their houses and pointing towards the forest.
Friends and family laughed and cried.
They gave each other hugs and kisses.
They were all together again.
Suddenly the whole town seemed to have more life.
The world started to break up into lines again.
Ada was bursting with pride, but she also had a bone to pick with Mrs.
Quigley.
What would happen if they could not finish a book?
She was going to find out.
Book Four The Yowie and the Bunyip.
When they had gotten out of the machine after the min min tale, Mrs.
Quigley had been asleep in her bedroom.
She didn't look well. They let her be.
Right after school the next day, they went to her house.
When she saw their grumpy gazes, she went pale.
Didn't you enjoy the last read?
Luckily, we were able to figure out what was going on, Ada said.
But what happens if we don't? Mrs.
Quigley looked at the floor and bit her lip.
That is the sad part, I will admit.
Darren started looking at some of the old newspapers around the room.
Many of them had pictures of missing children.
He didn't feel like they were hoaxes.
So it's possible to... get stuck? Or die?
Oh no, no, no, Mrs. Quigley said. Not die.
But get stuck... ? Lachlan asked.
Yes, I'm afraid so, she said.
I'll be waiting down in the basement, if you choose to keep reading, she said.
Well? Ada asked the others after Mrs.
Quigley had left.
We could get stuck in there, Darren said.
Yeah, but those two books have been the best times of my life, Lachlan said.
I am willing to risk it. Skink? Ada asked.
Maybe we can see how we go with each book?
And if one of us feels like it was too close, then they don't have to come back, Skink said.
That's a good idea, Ada said.
All four of them went down into the basement.
As the world of the book took shape, they found themselves in a crowd.
A man was at the front.
I understand. I do!
My own house was swept away in the last flood.
It flushes away all that we hold dear.
But no matter how far and wide we search, the beasts remain hidden.
We have put together a reward.
If you want to take this matter into your own hands, the cash is yours.
Reward?! Ada and Lachlan said at the same time.
The four of them walked out into the marshes and started searching for tracks.
Hours went by.
But then, they started to find fruit that had been snacked on and odd clumps of fur that had snagged on shrubs.
Finally, they got a whiff of a cave with a foul smell.
They saw two, large shapes in there.
Lachlan grabbed a tree branch, but Skink was already ahead of him.
She had become a lizard and was crawling into the cave.
Get back here! Lachlan hissed. What are you doing?
Maybe she's finding a better way to read this story instead of just hitting some poor beasts over the head, Darren said.
Lachlan jumped over a log and into the mouth of the cave.
They began to hear Skink's voice.
They crept closer and saw that she was talking to two massive animals.
One of them was like a large, hairy man.
The other was on all fours, with thick, shaggy fur and long whiskers coming out of its snout.
The beasts growled as the others came closer.
It's alright, Skink said, they’re with me.
Come on guys! This big one over here is a yowie!
And the cute, furry one is a bunyip!
Lachlan left the branch behind.
Go on, tell them what you told me, Skink said.
Pictures started playing in their minds.
They saw groups of yowies roaming all over the land, and packs of bunyips by the water.
People came to hunt animals, cut down trees, dry up rivers with their dams and all sorts of other destructive crazes.
The yowies and the bunyips tried to protect the land, but there were too many people.
Still want that reward now? Darren asked.
Ada and Lachlan looked down at the dirt.
What can we do? Ada asked.
They told me about a place, Skink said.
They have been making a raft to get there, but every time they leave the cave the townsfolk try to hunt them down.
Lachlan had an idea.
Lachlan got the feeling that Skink was about to change.
Each time she does, her vision glazes over.
He was right. This time she became a bunyip.
Lachlan tied her up and began walking her into town while Darren and Ada took the yowie and the bunyip through the tunnels to their raft.
When Lachlan and Skink got near the town, Lachlan pretended to lose hold of the rope and Skink started to rampage through the streets.
The whole town was trying to catch her, but she was fast.
Lachlan and Skink met back up at the cave with the others.
Did they make it? Skink asked.
Darren and Ada nodded. It was a nice place.
It might not be much, but at least they will get to live in peace, Darren said.
Lachlan smiled. That’s a great reward, he said.
Book Five The Gympie Gympie Tree.
Even though they had all said that they could stop at any time, the four of them met at Mrs.
Quigley's again the next afternoon.
Darren looked queasy when the next book came out.
Are you alright? Lachlan asked.
Yeah, it's just that, he said, pointing at the book.
Ada looked at the spine. What's a gympie gympie?
Ada asked.
Oh, just a plant that makes you feel like you're on fire for months.
That's all, Darren said.
Well, try not to touch it then, Lachlan said with a grin.
When they entered the world, the children found themselves by a forest.
There were hundreds of upset people holding tools.
A young man was running frantically between the different members of the town, begging them to stop and think.
The children approached him, and found that he was a botanist.
What’s happening? Ada asked the man.
I came here to study an odd strain of the gympie gympie.
It keeps uprooting itself and seeking out people to sting.
Usually that happens just a few times a year.
But since I began to study it, it has been happening a lot.
Skink looked around at all of the tools in horror.
Are they going to cut down the whole forest to find it?
she asked. The botanist nodded.
Maybe we can help, Lachlan offered.
The only way that you would be able to do that is to find the gympie gympie before anybody else can, said the scientist.
You say that it likes to seek out its prey?
Ada asked. Darren gulped. Yes. It smells fear.
If you could find a way to make it stop attacking and bring me back a cutting, they would think it was dead, and I could use the cutting for my studies.
Darren looked around helplessly.
Alright, he groaned. You can use me as bait.
Wonderful, Ada said.
The four children went down into the trees.
Darren, is there anything that can't get stung by a gympie gympie?
Skink asked. A pademelon.
They can eat them, he said. Excellent, Skink said.
She changed and started hopping through the dense bush.
Suddenly, they heard a rustling in the bushes.
Then a tiny plant started sprinting at them on its roots at full speed.
It was headed right for Darren.
Skink bounded forward and tackled the plant.
She held it tightly.
Can you understand me?
Ada said grumpily, bending down to the small tree.
It bent its upper branches forward and back as if it were nodding.
The whole forest is in danger because of you, she said.
It dug its roots into the ground and curled its leaves.
Were you angry that the botanist was trying to catch you?
The tree drooped. He wasn't trying to hurt you.
He just wanted to understand what makes you special, Ada said.
Wait, Darren said from far back.
He stepped forward. It isn’t its fault.
It just doesn’t want anybody coming after it or being in its space.
The rest of them thought about that for a moment.
But if it doesn't stop, everything around us is going to be torn down, Skink said.
Darren looked at the gympie gympie tree.
The only way around it would be if you stop running around seeking out people to sting.
You could live in the forest, but they would have to think you were dead, Darren said.
It was still for a moment, then nodded again.
And we would need to take one of your branches back as proof that we tracked you down.
The gympie gympie tree nodded and held out its largest branch.
They took it to the edge of the forest.
The botanist was waiting there for them.
People had already started hacking at some of the trees.
The botanist accepted the branch in gloved hands.
He rushed out of the forest to tell people that the threat of the tree was over.
Ada put an arm around Darren.
For one of the first times in his life he felt brave.
Book Six Lyre, Lyre, Pants on Fire.
The next time that the children entered a story world, it opened up on a school.
That’s no fun, Lachlan said.
Yeah, Ada complained.
We spent all day at school, and now we have to sit through more?
The four of them walked into the classroom.
Ada could not hide how bitter she felt.
When they walked in, they saw a strict woman at the front of the room.
She marched them to their assigned seats at each corner of the room.
There was an old book on each of their desks, some paper, and a pen.
Open to the first page and write, she said.
Until when? Ada asked.
Until you have finished the whole book.
When you need more paper, raise your hand, the teacher snapped, condemning them to hours of copying.
Ada stifled a groan.
They all had books about animals.
Ada loved reading about animals, but not like this.
Worst of all, she’d gotten birds.
Birds were so boring.
A girl seated next to her raised her hand. Miss?
What is it? she growled. This book isn’t right.
What? This fact. It’s wrong.
Do you still want me to copy it out?
The teacher drew back her lips in a snarl but no sound came out.
You think that you know better than BOOKS?
It says that they all lay eggs.
Some of them give live birth, Miss, the girl said.
She was pointing to a picture of a snake.
The teacher's head jolted back in fear.
You may omit that fact, she said.
Not long after that, a strange noise came from outside of the window just next to Ada.
YOU! the teacher shrieked at Ada.
Ada got up.
The teacher made her turn out her pockets.
I know I heard a phone she said, gnashing her teeth.
I think it was outside, Ada said.
Outside…? OUTSIDE? There's nobody outside!
You will keep going with your work, but now you will not have this, she said, taking Ada’s chair away.
Ada sighed and tried to keep writing while she was standing.
When it was nearly lunch time, Ada heard the phone alert again.
This time, she lost her desk and had to write with the paper on one half of the book.
The bell rang for lunch, and the four children went outside.
As they were chatting to each other, Ada heard a sound coming from behind some bushes.
There was a lovely, grey bird looking up at them.
It had interesting tail feathers.
Some of them were fluffy and white while others were brown and stripey.
I saw this just now!
In the book that I was reading. Thats a lyrebird!
Ada said in an excited whisper.
The bird opened its mouth, and the sound of the phone came out.
They can mimic sounds around them, Ada said, grinning down at the bird.
You guys head back to the school yard.
Give me a sign if shes coming.
I have some work to do, Ada said.
The three of them walked off and watched as Ada crouched near the lyrebird, designing a new part for its song.
When the bell rang, she walked in with them.
Just after they had started copying things out of their books, there was a hissing in the classroom.
Darren, Lachlan, and Skink covered their smirks.
The teacher stalked around near Ada to make sure that it was not coming from her.
The sound moved along the windows outside. SNAKE!
she cried as she ran out of the door.
Ada got up and looked out to the street.
The teacher was already around the corner.
She turned around to the rest of the class.
School's out!
They all cheered as they rushed outside to play.
As the world began to fade, Ada heard beeps and hisses coming from the bushes and grinned.
Book Seven The Strangler.
When they arrived in the next story world, the children saw a bright street full of bustling homes and businesses.
But just when they were considering playing with some of the kids on the street, Lachlan spotted a house that looked lonely and unkempt.
The house filled them all with sadness.
It sat under the shade of an old tree that had been consumed by a strangler fig.
The fig had claimed the house as well, stretching its vines through broken windows and under doors.
I've seen that sort of vine before, Lachlan said.
The roots cut off the tree's nutrients from the soil and the leaves spread out above it so that it can't get any sun.
They could not get in the house or hear anybody inside.
Then, Skink looked up. Is that a guitar?
she asked.
The other three looked up to where she was pointing, and saw that she was right.
Lachlan began to climb the tree.
Skink transformed into a magpie and beat him up there.
She alighted on a branch. There's so much up here!
Lachlan said with wonder. There's books.
clothes... a whole house full of stuff.
Ada and Darren joined them up in the strangler fig.
There were indeed books and clothes abound.
Skink flew up to scout things out.
She saw large, brown sacs where the vines had coiled themselves around two forms and hardened.
A man’s foot sticking out the bottom of one.
A lock of long, curly hair came out the top of the other.
Lachlan climbed up and began to unwind the vine sacs.
I'm sorry, do we know you?
the man asked when he and his wife were free.
No, Lachlan said, we just found you here and it looked like you needed help.
The two of them kept blinking in confusion.
Is that your home down there? Darren asked.
That isn't a home anymore.
That is just a house, he said. His wife nodded.
She turned to the children.
Thank you for coming up here to wake us.
It has been such a long time since anybody has reached out to us.
That’s alright, Ada said quietly.
Should we help you start to move your things down?
Lachlan asked. They thought.
Well, it does all seem to be up here, doesn’t it?
the man said, turning to his wife.
Yes, I think this will do quite nicely, she said, nodding.
But the strangler is still alive, Ada said.
It could be fatal if it gets you again.
It is, but it is slow moving, the lady said.
We were still for a long time, her husband said.
We won't make that mistake again.
The children bid them farewell and began to climb down the strangler again.
Something still weighed on them.
As they climbed down past the gowns and art supplies, they came back to the level where there were toys, children’s books, and tiny clothes.
You didn’t see another sac up there, did you?
Skink asked as she hovered around them.
The three of them shook their heads.
I guess that explains why they didn't want to be a part of the world for a while, Darren said.
When they got to the bottom of the strangler, the world had not begun to disappear yet.
But then a halo of light appeared far up the tree as they started to turn on lights and arrange their new home.
The children started to hear music floating down from the top of the vine, and the tale felt complete.
The world began to fade.
Book Eight Toadpocalypse.
The next afternoon that they were walking to Mrs.
Quigley’s, Darren had a thought.
We are over halfway, you know.
She only has a few books left.
These might be the only other stories left in the whole world, Darren continued.
They were all silent for the rest of the walk.
The only sound was sniffling from Ada.
She had gotten something at school and was trying to fight it off.
She did not want to spend the weekend in bed.
The moment that they went into the story world, they knew that this was not going to be like the others.
The other stories had felt like the past or the present.
This felt like the future.
Everything was bleak and smoggy.
There were small fires all over the place.
The streets were covered in trash and the shop fronts were broken.
They began to walk down the road.
Gross!
Ada exclaimed as she put a foot down on the road.
Her sneaker had sunk into a thick layer of goo that lined the ground.
She looked down and saw that it was organs.
Remember when we watched that toad dissection in biology?
Darren asked. But how can that be?
These entrails are huge, Ada said softly.
The squiggly entrails made it look like a giant bowl of ramen had been spilled all over the whole world.
They continued on down the road.
Sometimes their sneakers would be sucked into the gizzards and they would take a step in their bare socks.
This was the grossest story by far.
They went by a building and heard people inside.
They found a group of humans huddled together.
They explained that they had been cut off from one of the larger communities.
They were clinging to golf clubs and pitch forks.
None of them would speak the name of the monsters that were hunting them, but one stammered out the location of the main nest.
The closer that they got to the nest, the more Skink objected.
The sound went far without all of the normal city noise.
Soon the toads were upon them.
The foul creatures were at least twice the size of an adult human, with large pockets of fat and muscle bulging over their forelimbs.
They frowned their sharp brows as they looked down at the children.
Some of the toads went behind them so that they were forced to move along the road where the toads wanted them to go.
Inside of the nest, they found that the toads had caught a prisoner.
He explained that the toads had been kidnapped and taken to this place long ago by careless humans.
They’d had no natural predators, and quickly took over.
Over time, they grew large and strong, Soon, they began to wonder why it was that humans got to live in lovely houses and toads were killed on the street.
They started a war, and it did not look like humans were going to win.
Just then, Ada sneezed.
Snot went all over the room!
All of the giant, fleshy toads suddenly began keeling over.
The man went from body to body.
They had all been struck down by Ada's sickness!
How did you know that would work? the man asked.
Ada sniffed. I didn't.
Lucky break, I guess, she said.
I’m free! he yelled. We all are!
The children walked around the city looking for other groups of people who needed protecting.
When the toads came, Ada let out almighty sneezes and launched snot at them.
She also bottled some in a jar for the people of that world so that they could test and use it.
She had enough to go around.
Before they left, a man asked them questions about their journey.
He wanted to write a book about the heroes of their town.
Ada could not talk without snot coming out of her nose, so Darren helped out.
As the book ended, Darren wondered what happened to the worlds after they were done with them.
If the books had been destroyed by the machine, were the world gone forever too?
Book Nine The Belly of the Beast.
What’s that?
Lachlan asked as the town before them began to take shape.
The four children headed to the notice board.
Each note was about a loved one that had gone missing.
They felt like they might be able to solve the mystery if they just kept looking for clues between the people.
And then.
Huh, Darren said.
The other three turned to him and waited for him to continue talking.
Is it just me, or do all of these stories have something to do with the water?
You might be right, Ada said. Boating accidents.
Beach trips. Fishing.
It’s not that much to go on though, Darren said.
I don’t know, Ada said, looking at the slow moving river to their side.
That might be a good place to start.
They trekked along the dark in the riverbank.
As the river got deeper, the rushing water got louder.
After a while, it went out into the sea.
They walked as quietly as they could on the bits of leaves and sticks, trying to prevent themselves from making as much noise as possible.
While they wanted to find whatever was causing the disappearances, they didn’t exactly want to disappear themselves.
Before any of them could react, a gigantic crocodile launched itself out of the water.
With one snap of its jaws, it swallowed Skink whole and dashed back down into the depths.
Lachlan went to dive right in after it, but Ada and Darren held him back.
They weren’t prepared to lose two of them so quickly.
Skink opened her eyes and her brain went into overdrive.
She was looking down into a huge cavern with fleshy walls.
There was at least one hundred people in there, and many more animals.
All of them were still alive.
There were signs to show where and when the creatures had arrived.
All of the people were working with each other to keep all of the animals fed, safe, and happy.
Skink moved further into the cavern as the crocodile gulped down a good deal of fish.
People came to collect the food and found her looking around in wonder.
Hello dear, a lady said.
New to the crocodile, are you?
I’m sorry, Skink started, but I have no idea what is going on.
They looked at her for a moment.
You mean you weren’t trying to seek out the crocodile?’ She shook her head.
The crocodile sent down some roots and plants for the herbivores.
Well, we can get him to send you out right now if you’d like?
There must have been some mistake, the old man said.
How is that? Skink asked.
Well, the crocodile usually only swallows people who have heard the legend of his stomach.
We are animal lovers that travel all over the world in the crocodile.
This is like a… natural history museum?
I love those! Skink said.
Well, I don’t know about history.
We keep all of our animals very much alive.
But it isn’t really a zoo.
The animals are free to leave when they want.
Some never do.
Skink walked around the crocodile with the old man and saw the animals that were being housed in its stomach.
She met chameleons and watched them change their skin to all kinds of hues.
Narwhals were there with their long tooth tusks.
Vampire squid from the deep sea bobbed around with their umbrella shaped bodies in tanks.
Skink even started to see some animals that she swore had gone extinct, like the dodo.
It appeared that the crocodile had been at work for a long time.
Skink put on a show for the human occupants, transforming into some of their favourites.
Then the old man walked up near where Skink had fallen in.
Could you do us a favour?
Please tell those on the outside that the people here are alright.
They will be back in time, but the adventure is too much to pass up.
Skink crawled up the throat and stood in the jaws, looking out.
The crocodile brought Skink to the shore and she stepped out.
Then it closed its jaws and sank back into the sea.
Skink and the others responded to each of the notes on the notice board with Gone travelling.
Be back soon.
Book Ten Cassowary Country.
In the next book, the children came into the world by a rainforest.
There were old, broken houses near them.
When they started walking towards the houses, they heard some scuffling from shrubs to the side.
It was a kind of whooping noise and then a bark.
Hey guys, Lachlan said.
Remember when we went to that zoo for school?
How could I forget! Skink said.
I'm pretty sure I remember that sound, Lachlan said.
Soon, Lachlan found out that he was right.
A formidable bird came tearing out of the tall shrubs.
It had a tall neck atop a plump body covered in black feathers.
Its legs were scaly and ended in sharp talons.
And crowning the blue head with its enormous beak was a tall crest.
A cassowary.
There's no way we can outrun that thing, Ada said, breathless from fear.
Maybe I could transform and try to make it chase after me and leave you guys alone?
Skink said.
Lachlan stepped forward, looking at it right in the eyes.
He was trying to formulate a plan. Be careful!
Darren hissed. It will gut you!
Just then, a person came running out from one of the busted up houses.
She had a large piece of scrap iron like a shield in front of her.
In the other hand, she held a broom.
Into the house! she yelled towards the children.
The cassowary reared up and kicked iron.
The children ran into the house.
From the window, they watched amazed as the lady took blows from the bird, holding up the iron sheet.
She shook the broom in front of the bird and then threw it far off towards a rock formation.
The cassowary ran after it, and she got back to the house safely.
Who are you?
Ada asked as the lady put her her iron by the door.
My name is Emily, she said with a warm smile, not at all like the warrior she has been outside.
I live here.
How? Darren asked.
I've been here all my life, Emily said.
After the cassowaries took over, most people left.
My dad and I stayed. What do you do here?
he asked. Dad takes pictures of them.
I study them.
We work to keep both people and the cassowaries safe.
Lachlan started walking around the room.
There were cassowary sketches and pictures all over the house.
Wonderful, arent they?
Emily said when she saw Lachlan looking around the room.
We are so fortunate to still have them here.
All birds might have come from therapod dinosaurs, but these ones play the part a lot more than others.
Therapod? Skink asked.
T rex, velociraptor, that kind of thing, Lachlan said as he kept looking around the house.
The feathered, two legged carnivores.
Why are they still attacking you?
Lachlan asked Emily.
They want their land back. They need to roam wide.
Year by year, their home grew smaller.
Why not leave them be then? Lachlan asked.
There are not many of them left, and we want to give them the best chance we can.
Dad and I are trying to grow back some of their forest.
We are taking the houses down as we go, but we can’t get the right type of seeds.
Those bushes and trees are deep in the forest, and the cassowaries won’t let us in there.
Lachlan turned to the group.
There was something in the forefront of his mind.
You remember when we saw the ones in the zoo?
They had a sign over them that said Rainforest Gardeners.
They eat lots of different seeds and berries and poop them out in other places.
So? Ada asked.
Skink, we might need you after all, Lachlan said with a grin.
Skink and Lachlan went to the door.
He took the iron, a sack, a trowel and a fresh broom.
Then Skink transformed, and he climbed onto her back.
The others waited, looking anxiously out the window for their return.
Finally, they came back into the clearing and up to the house.
Lachlan leapt off Skins back.
He opened up the sac for Emily.
It was full of poop from different cassowaries.
The poo was rainbow coloured and had a huge mix of seeds.
Emily was very pleased and went to get her microscope and books on plant types.
The children held their breath so that they did not breathe in the stink.
The scene started to shift away, and it couldn’t have happened soon enough.
Book Eleven The Drop Bears.
Before the children knocked on Mrs.
Quigley's door the next time they went around to her house, they stood on the front steps for a while.
Last one, Darren said.
A faint voice coming from inside, telling them to open the door.
Mrs. Quigley was lying down on the couch.
She looked pale.
Would it be better for us to come back another time?
Darren asked. Don’t mind me.
You go downstairs and finish what you started, she said, shutting her eyes with a soft smile.
The children made her some tea and toast and then went downstairs.
They put themselves into the machine and got ready to read their last fiction book.
As was the case with the other books, they arrived in a town with a problem.
They wondered whether there had been some sort of thieves, like the bowerbirds or the strangler fig.
They spread out and spoke to people in the crowd.
People had been attacked and kidnapped.
Ada headed for a policeman.
The attacks all had one thing in common: drop bears had come to town.
The attacks had happened in a few different places, but a lot of them were near the forest.
The children began to head that way.
They heard something moving about in the leaves, but it was just a family of foxes coming out of their den.
Then, there was a gruff sort of bark.
The foxes fled.
They looked up into the trees and found the culprits.
After all that the children had seen, they weren’t frightened of the little drop bears.
They had nothing on giant toads.
Aw, Skink said. They are so cute.
The drop bears barked again.
It was like getting heckled on the street.
The children laughed and beamed up at them.
Why aren't you running off in terror?
We've kind of seen a lot together, Ada said.
Would you mind moving on then? said the drop bear.
Somebody else might come through soon.
We need to give something a good scare.
We’re starving.
There has been nothing to nibble on for days.
You live off fear? Lachlan asked.
Hey, everything has to eat, the leader of the drop bears said.
Do you scare people to death? Ada asked.
No, they just run off.
Why do you move around so much? Darren asked.
We need to go from town to town because people come after us, the drop bear said.
It seemed that the problems that they had to solve had doubled.
I think I have a way that we might be able to avoid that, Darren said with a twinkle in his eye.
He took the others aside and made a plan.
They went back into town and found the policeman that Ada had been speaking to.
They asked about an old shack that they had seen near the forest.
The policeman heard them out and agreed to give it a try.
The next night, everything was set.
There was a line of people outside of the new haunted house.
It was quite a spectacle.
They collected money as people went inside, putting it in a box to give to the town at the end of the night.
When people walked in, they heard shrieks of terror, but as they walked out, they were laughing.
At the end of the night, the four of them had a lot of cash to find the lost people and the drop bears had full bellies.
They had become expert readers indeed.
The children watched until every last detail disappeared into the black.
Book Twelve All Good Things.
A few weeks later, Ada told the others to meet her after school at the park around the corner.
When they were alone, she pulled a scarf out of her backpack.
It was covering a familiar shape.
They had been inside reading boring books for school all day.
Ada pulled back the scarf and they saw a hint of hideous teeth and claws on the cover.
Did you go to see Mrs. Quigley? Darren asked.
Nope, Ada said, beaming. I found it in my attic.
My parents went out to see a film together last night, so I started poking about seeing if I could find anything fun to do.
Best of all, there's a giant box of them there!
I bet if you searched your houses as well, we would find more.
She had made her mind up that it was stupid to have burned the fiction books.
Still, that didn’t mean that they wouldn’t have to be careful.
Ada covered the book back up and put it in her bag.
If anybody saw them, it would doubtless be taken away.
Worst of all, her parents could get in trouble.
She didn’t want her parents to have to be punished because she had been careless.
The children began to head over to see Mrs.
Quigley, hoping that she would be alright with them using her machine for books that weren't her own.
They all liked the walk to Mrs. Quigley's.
They had a lot of fond memories of the secret conversations that they would have on the way there.
But when they rounded the corner, the world changed.
There was an ambulance outside of Mrs.
Quigley's house. Lachlan put an arm around Skink.
Darren went to talk to the paramedics. Mrs.
Quigley had passed away in the night.
They asked if the children knew her, and Darren said no.
Ada was about to yell at him, but took a moment to think.
If they had found anything inside the house, it was best not to be connected with her.
It could cause some genuine problems for them.
Ada wasnt the type of person that cried easily, but she found herself crying now.
Skink was in denial.
She couldn't believe that Mrs. Quigley was gone.
A man who had lived diagonally across from Mrs.
Quigley's house came out as the paramedics drove the body away.
You're those kids that messed up Edna's garden, aren't you?
That made Ada cry even more.
She hadn't even known her first name.
Lachlan and Darren each put an arm around her.
Skink was still staring off down the road where the ambulance had gone.
Yes sir, Darren replied.
She said that you would turn up, the old man said.
She said to give you this.
He handed them an envelope.
Ada knew that it was smarter to open it later, but she couldn't help herself.
She quickly scanned the letter and thanked the man.
Then they went down to the river near Mrs.
Quigley's house.
She wanted us to break in, Ada said.
Ada got out the letter to show them all to prove it.
After 24 hours, the police go in to search the house and seize anything that shouldn't be there.
But there is a law that stops them from doing that until then.
She wants us to go into the basement and take the machine out of there so that her husband's legacy won't be lost.
Ada and Darren called their parents and said that they were staying at each other's houses to study.
The children waited until dark.
Piece by piece, they took the machine apart.
They fit most of the bits in their backpacks and put the tank under a few jackets.
Together, they lugged the parts over the Lachlan and Skinks house.
Their parents were busy and didn't get up as the children came in.
The four of them went down to the basement.
They never come down here, Lachlan said.
They won't notice a thing.
The children realigned all the parts of the machine.
They were surprised how intuitive it was to put back together.
They booted it up, and the odd liquid in the tank between to swirl.
Well, here we go… Ada said, getting ready to put the book into the tank.
Each of them thought of Mrs.
Quigley as they strapped the machine to their heads.
Then, a new world began to appear.
We have told tales of dragons for a long time.
We can read tales of dragons from Europe.
Most dragons from Europe are mean beasts.
They breathe fire and take gold.
This is a German dragon. It is a puk.
If you make it glad, it brings gold.
If you do not, it gets mad.
Most dragons of Europe have wings and legs.
They can give us a scare.
Some were half dragon and half beast in the tales.
A lot were a mix of a dragon and a bird or a dragon and a big cat.
There is a lot of dragon art in Europe.
Gargoyles are a kind of dragon.
They are from a French tale.
Norse dragons are very mean.
There is a tale that one of them lives at the base of the world tree.
Some tales told of dragons in the sea.
Some of them were like snakes.
Some were like fish or whales.
We have given some stars and rocks in the sky the names of dragons.
Saint George went to war with the dragon to kill it.
Have you read the tale of Saint George and the dragon?
This dragon ate girls.
A dragon that is in a lot of art from Europe is one that bites its tail.
It is from an old book found in Egypt.
Dragons are fun to read up on.
There will always be dragons in our books, games and films.
There are a lot of stories about dragons that have been told through time.
They are not real, but they can tell us a lot about the places that they are from.
In this book, we will look at some ways that people told stories about dragons in Europe long ago.
Most dragons from Europe are mean beasts.
They have bad labels.
They steal gold, kidnap people, and launch attacks on towns.
In these stories, there is often a hero that slays the dragon and brings peace.
Here is a tiny, German dragon called a puk.
If you are good to it, a puk will sleep in the house and steal things for you.
If you are not, it will burn you or torch the house down.
Most dragons of Europe have wings, legs and feet with claws.
Many have horns.
They are the types of dragons that give you a fright to look at.
Some dragons are hybrids, which means that they have parts of other beasts.
It is common to see dragon hybrids that have the back or front of big cats and birds.
When you start looking, dragons are on all sorts of things.
You can see items from European history with dragons.
Some were for fights and others were works of art.
There are also a lot of dragon statues, such as gargoyles.
These dragons come from a French legend.
Slavic and Norse dragons are often on the next level.
They are mean and scary.
One Norse dragon is a small brute that crawls in the roots of the world tree and chews at them.
Some dragons were sea serpents or other beasts.
Old maps had drawings of these monsters around some waters.
It was to warn sailors of what may haunt those seas.
Sometimes the maps had Here be dragons on them.
You can even look for dragons in the night sky.
There are a few groups of stars named after dragons.
We name a lot of other things up there after myths as well, like planets and asteroids.
Saint George slayed the dragon to rescue the princess, taking refuge from its venom under an orange tree.
A well liked dragon story is that of Saint George.
A dragon made demands for a maiden to be brought to it daily for it to eat.
The last one left was the princess.
This is a symbol that you see in a lot of games, films and novels.
It shows a dragon with its tail in its mouth.
It stands for many things, such as the cycles in the world.
Dragons can be found all over.
The ways that people think about these beasts shift over time, but we will always have their stories around.
Tales involving dragons have been told around the world all through history.
In this book, we will be looking at dragon stories that originated or are popular in Europe.
These dragons have a lot of similarities, and their tales can tell us something about how people saw the world through the years.
We see European style dragons in a lot of movies, books and games.
They have some amazing stories behind how they came to be, what they did and, sometimes, how they were slain.
Most of the dragons in stories from Europe are mean beasts.
They fly over towns and spew forth fire to burn them all up.
They take treasure and kidnap fancy maidens.
When a knight comes to fight a dragon to take back what it has stolen, it is always a grand battle.
Some dragons in European stories are small but still troublesome.
This is a puk, which originates from German folklore.
It is said that a puk will come into a house and aim to bond with the people there.
If it is treated fairly, it will steal treasures for the household from neighbours.
If it is scorned, it will burn people or torch the whole house down.
When a dragon has many heads, it is called a hydra.
The number of heads can vary.
Hercules fought a hydra as one of his labours.
The tricky thing about going into battle with a hydra is that when you cut off one head, two new ones immediately sprout in its place!
There are also a lot of stories about creatures that are hybrids.
These are beasts that are a mixture of different kinds of animals.
They are not traditionally dragons, but many had dragon like qualities.
Two popular ones were the griffin and the manticore.
A griffin has the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion.
A manticore has the body of a lion, the tail of a scorpion and wings.
They can also have the face of a man.
If you look at artifacts from medieval times, there are dragons all over the place.
They were often carved or painted on weapons, shields, flags, armour and decorative treasures.
You might also be familiar with gargoyles, which are statues that can often be seen on buildings in cities or by bridges.
They come from a French legend.
Slavic and Norse dragons were some of the most fearsome brutes.
It was common in Slavic stories for dragons to be the masters of weather.
It was also thought that dragons started out their lives as snakes.
One of the most famous dragons in Norse mythology lives at the roots of the world tree, chewing at its roots.
The world tree supports the nine worlds in Norse mythology.
Nidhogg stands for chaos and evil, but it still has an important role in the ecosystem of the world tree that helps it to grow.
It is trapped in the roots of the tree.
The tales say that then the dragon finally chews free, the great war of Ragnarok will begin.
Some dragons were sea serpents or other beasts of the sea, such as monstrous whales and other sea monsters.
Some maps long ago has drawings of monsters in uncharted seas and the text Here be dragons.
This represented dangerous and unknown waters.
A famous monster of the sea was Cetus, whose tale comes from Greek mythology.
We can even see dragons when we look to space!
People have named many planets, constellations, asteroids and other bodies in space after mythology.
There are a few constellations named after dragons, such as Draco, Cetus, and Hydra.
One of the largest asteroids in the belt between Mars and Jupiter is called Apophis after the world eater in Egyptian myth.
Egypt is not in Europe, but dragon stories from there have played a big part in European culture.
One of the best known dragon stories is that of Saint George and the dragon.
Have you ever seen the green dragon on the Welsh flag?
That dragon represents this story.
This dragon was gobbling up all of the maidens in the area.
It has gotten to the point that only the princess was left.
Saint George battled and slayed the dragon to rescue the princess.
He did this by taking shelter from the dragon's venom under an orange tree.
This is one of the most well known dragon symbols.
It is from the Book of the Dead in Egypt, but it has become important all across the world.
The dragon is shown to be either biting or swallowing its tail.
This stands for many things, including the cycles of life.
Dragons have always been an important part of our stories around the world.
People are likely to keep telling dragon stories through time.
Reading dragons stories from different parts of the world can help us to understand the morals and thoughts that people had at the time.
What will dragon stories in the future hold?

I stand on a hill. My fans clap.
I go up! I spin. I zip. I twirl.
The fans yell and clap. I can fly well.
Jill goes to see Gran.
Gran has a lot of books.
Gran sits in her spot.
Jill asks what Gran likes to read.
Gran says that she is reading these three.
Jill hands Gran one to read with her.
Gran tells it so well!
Gran makes bits up as well.
Gran makes books fun.
Jill hugs the book. She loves to read.
He wants to have fun.
He has not done his work for class.
The work is hard. Dad tells him not to quit.
His dad can help.
His dad writes on the board.
He does not go fast.
He gets it! He can do the work so well!
A kiss for dad.
Turn on the tank.
The plants get a drink.
Gran goes up.
She gets the nuts.
I must crack it.
Get the husk off.
Gran cuts the nut. Got it!
I dig bits off.
Gran puts the bits in the pot.
Tip it in the tin.
Cut it up.
Got it!
He can spy a word.
He can spy the word Pa'.
He can find Ma'.
He can spy hen'!
He can spy cat'!
It is a hard word.
It jumps up!
It can be a pal.
He can spy a lot of pals.
This is a bike. That is a big bike.
That is a fast bike.
Here is a car. There is a bus.
I am in the bus. There is a digger.
Here I am in the digger. There is a jet ski.
Here I am on the jet ski. There is a boat.
I am on the boat. It is fast! There is a big ship.
I find dad on the ship.
I went here and there on bikes, boats and more!
The sun is here. Time for kites!
My pals have theirs up.
I made a kite as well!
I cut out the cloth.
I put on the twine.
I made it look cute.
Will it fly like a plane?
Yes! Up it goes!
I hide at the back. I pull the twine.
I can lift up her arm. She can wave to the side.
I can bend her arm to pluck the plants.
I can pull the strings and have her tell us things.
I make them all. I cut and stitch.
It is fun to make things.
Don is at the shop.
Don gets a cap.
The cap is off!
The cap at the top.
Don is sad.
The moon is up.
The moon is in his cap!
Don gets a red cap.
Cap pals.
Does the sun get a cap?
Wheels are on a lot of things.
A big wheel that spins so that we can have fun.
Wheels in a clock that let the hands move.
Wheels on a farm. They help us to do jobs.
We can see wheels all over.
But what if there were no wheels?
We could not make a lot of things.
We would have to work hard for food and clothes.
Parts of it would be fun, but not all of it.
Things would have to be the way that they used to be.
But it would not all be so bad.
With no wheels, the world would be clean.
Wheels or no wheels? They both have pros and cons.
Red is on a walk.
The din jars him.
Red is lost.
Red must find his pal.
Can Red find him?
Red trots on.
Red can get to his pal.
Red can get past the din.
His pal?
Yes!
Red and his pal walk.
We love to go and see the lights in the town, but the best lights are when there is a festival on.
People come in and set up lights that turn the night into day.
If you look out at the town at night, you see lights in all of the houses and shops.
Lights mean that we can still do things after dark.
What if the lights all went out one day?
It would be a very different world.
You could not see well at night.
You might get scared.
We would not be able to do very much at night.
It would be like medieval times.
We would have to live by the sun.
The road are only safe to drive at night because we have lights to guide the way.
We can see other cars and bikes.
We can see where people need to cross.
If the lights went out, the roads would be a mess.
Cars would hit each other and people would get mad.
You could not get far.
Lights can bring us a lot of joy as well.
It is so fun to go to a carnival at night.
We can go on the rides and play games to win toys!
There can be no rides if the lights go out.
If the power is off, it stops a lot of things from working.
No more carnivals.
A lighthouse is one way that lights keep us safe.
Ships need lighthouses to show them where to go.
They need to keep clear of rocks.
If there were no lights, a ship would not know when it needed to slow down.
It might hit a small boat or run into a cliff.
When you start to think about it, you see that we make use of lights a lot in our lives.
If we want to have the same lifestyle as we do now, we need lights.
We can learn about light and how it gets to us.
If we are smart with how we make and use power, we do not have to go without.
I am not like all fish. I can hop up on the land.
I can pop in the next pond.
I eat bugs. Yum!
Do not eat that worm!
As I eat a lot, I get big.
I get big fins!
The fins help me get up and be safe.
The pond is a bog.
I must get in the mud.
The fins help me find a soft spot.
I dig in the mud.
I nap in the mud. And I get up in….
the rain!
I am not like all fish.
A bug! Run to get it!
By a hiss.
By pals.
A lot of bugs!
It is not a pal.
Turn!
Run!
By the bugs.
By the pals.
By the hiss.
Get to Ma.
My Ma is best.
Bee is lost. It wants to go home.
Is this nest his home?
No! A nest is a home for birds.
Is this cave his home?
No! A cave is a home for bats.
Is this hive his home?
Yes! Bees live in a hive.
But now she wants to go home.
Bee will help.
In my life, I have my pals.
I have my pop and bike rides.
I have my nan and pets.
I have things that are fun.
I have a mind that can think.
I have dogs to play with.
I have a mum and dad to care for me.
I have an uncle and plants.
I have a brother and bugs.
I have a lot of things that I love in my life.
Vic has a gift for us.
Vic is good at sport.
It is a ball!
Vic tells us how to play.
We must jump up and hit the ball.
The ball goes up and over the net.
If the ball lands, they do not win.
The game got its start in America.
But you can play in any spot with a net.
Vic can help us play.
Hit the ball up!
The dog wants to play.
Tiger has no pals. She likes it like that.
A mouse gets close then runs off.
Tiger does not want to share.
The monkeys tell their pals to hide if Tiger is there.
They all run. No pals for Tiger.
The stag calls. Tiger is close!
No snacks here! Off you go, Tiger.
She makes fine art. She has tubes of paint.
The yellow tube does not want to be used.
She wants to start now. She gets out her work.
She starts with some plants. The plants bend.
She does some men that live in the sky.
She does a girl sprite with fine lines.
She paints a cave with drips like ink.
She takes a rest. The cat has some twine.
She stops to open the blinds. The sun is up!
She has a talk to yellow. It wants to help.
Yellow is in the art! It made the art look so fun.
I want to fly.
I will go to a class so that they can teach me.
When I can fly well, I think I will try to fly in films.
I will get fans!
I try to set off into the sky. Bonk!
I land in the dirt.
The birds in my class say that I stink at flying.
My pride sinks, but that will not stop me.
I will take the next class.
If my wings are too small, I will make some big wings!
I learn how to twist and turn the wings so that I can go the way that I want to.
It is the big day! I will take to the sky.
Birds come to see how my wings will go.
The wind picks up.
I turn my wings so that I catch it.
It sends me high up!
The birds on the grass clap. I got my fans!
I want to fly, but I have found it hard to learn by myself.
Some birds need a bit of help to fly.
I will sign up for a class.
When I have learned how to fly, I am going to go for roles in films.
I will be able to dive out of airplanes and fly on.
I will have a lot of fans!
In my first class, I try to take off into the sky.
I land hard on a hilltop.
The other birds in the class laugh at me as I lie there in the dirt.
They swoop around me and tell me that I will never be able to fly.
I pick myself up and walk away from my classmates.
My pride is hurt. They can all fly so well.
They tell me that I am too big.
They say that birds like me never get off the ground.
If my wings are too small to help me off the ground, I will make myself some big wings that will lift me up on the breeze.
I read books about wings and make a pair that I can bend and twist any way that I want to!
Then, I get set to take to the skies!
This is the day!
I have done some test flights, but it is time for the big one.
A lot of birds have come to see how my wings will fare.
Some are fans. Some hope they will not work.
A strong breeze starts to blow.
It sends me high up into the sky!
I dive and twist in the air.
I can do all sorts of tricks!
The birds on the ground cheer and ask for more.
I put on the best show that I can, then I land back down next to my fans.
I have a goal.
It is to make some food from yard to plate.
The first thing that I must do is dig loads of holes for the seeds.
As I drop the seeds in, the birds float by.
They try to peck at the seeds.
The plants start to poke up from the dirt.
I give them a drink. They soak it up.
I do not moan or groan.
I tend to my plants with love.
I do groan when our pets want to snack on my plants.
I make a pen to stop them.
When it is time, I pick what I want to use.
I load the food up.
I scrub the food to get rid of the coat of dirt.
My mum and I chop it all up.
We roast it in a big pot.
It was a big job to go from yard to plate.
I do not boast, but I am glad the dish went well.
We grow a lot of crops on our farm.
I can grow my own food and make a meal from scratch!
The first thing that I need to do is dig holes in a vacant part of our land.
The soil must not be too hard.
It must be good soil that will help the plants grow.
When I put seeds in the holes, birds come from near and far to snack on them.
I need to cover up the seeds so that the birds do not peck at them.
The plants start to poke up out of the soil.
I give them water every day so that they will be strong.
The plants are all in good health.
They are a verdant green.
They grow so much every day.
I check on them so that I can keep track of their needs.
The cows and hens like the look of my crops.
I tie up some gates to keep them out.
They have their own food.
When they look done, I pick what I need for my meal.
I love that I can use fresh food that I have grown.
I make sure to wash the food well.
I love to work in the soil, but it has things that can make us sick.
My mum and I like to cook out in the yard.
We light two fires so that we can use our pan and our big pot.
The fires light in an instant.
We wait for them to go down a bit.
Then we add the food.
When the food is done, I find my dad and sisters.
They had to put the cows and hens to bed so that they are safe in the night.
We eat up all of the food.
It is a shame when food goes to waste.
We do not cook more than we need.
My dad got us a sweet snack to end the meal on.
He said that all of our hard work warrants a treat.
Sweets all round!
I want to work on a bit of art.
My mind does not buzz with ideas.
Dad sits by me. He paints.
Mum sits by me. She cuts.
Nan sits by me. She sticks.
Pop sits by me. He writes.
My brother sits by me. He has a fix.
I can do it all! I cut and stick and write.
I make a book.
Jill goes to see Gran so that they can read side by side.
Gran has more than a few books.
It is like a book nook!
Gran sits in her spot and drinks a cup of tea.
Jill asks which books Gran is reading.
Gran says that she likes to have a few books on the go.
Jill hands Gran a new book so that she can read it to her.
Gran reads with style.
At times she stops to let the words stew in our minds.
Jill loves how Gran tells a story.
She makes her own bits up.
Gran can make any book fun.
Jill wants to be like that too.
Jill hugs the book.
Her love for books grew from her time with Gran.
Jill wants to spend some time at her grandmother's house.
It is full of books that they can share.
It is like a book nook!
Jill goes right up to a bookshelf.
She thinks that old books have a great smell to them.
She likes how they feel as well.
Her grandmother sits in her armchair with a teacup in hand.
It makes her grandmother smile when Jill is keen to read.
It is a love that they can bond over.
Jill asks what book they are going to read.
She does not mind what sort, as her grandmother can make any book fun.
Her grandmother says that she has three books on the go, but she wants Jill to pick a new book for today.
Jill picks a small, brown book with a thin spine.
Her grandmother smiles.
She tells Jill that she always picks the best books.
Jill’s grandmother starts to tell the story.
She likes to pause as she reads so that Jill can think about what is happening.
Jill’s grandmother also likes to make up her own parts of the story.
Jill likes her grandmother’s parts the best.
Before they know it, they have finished the book.
Jill’s grandmother asks what she likes about it.
Is there anything that she would change?
No, Jill loved it! She gives the book a hug.
The best thing about books is that they can take you off to new worlds.
A family with their brown and white pup.
A kite goes by! Bub grabs on.
Bub goes up.
She wants to see the whole town from up high.
The pup takes hold of Bub.
She wants to keep her down.
Tim turns. He gets a hold on the pup.
The pup keeps a hold of Bub.
Tim goes up! Kim grabs his leg. They both go up!
Lyn grabs Kim by the boot. Mum puts out her hand.
Mum is the key. She holds fast.
They start to come down.
They are all back down on the bench.
Now they are safe.
Bub lets go of the kite. The kite sails off.
Bye, kite!
Bub sees a kite. She takes an interest in it.
She puts out her hands to grab it.
She has seen kites up in the sky.
She wants to fly up high.
Oh no! Bub goes up. The wind blows.
Her family have their eyes shut against the wind.
The pup sees. Can she save her?
The pup grabs her by the foot.
She tries to keep Bub down, but there is a strong wind.
The kite is pulling her up and up!
A bark from the pup interrupts Tim.
He turns to see that the pup and Bub are going up.
He grabs on so that he can pull the two of them down.
Tim floats up as well!
Kim grabs her brother by the leg.
She is not strong enough to pull them all down.
She becomes part of the kite train.
Lyn tries to interfere in the kite’s plans, but she is still not strong enough!
They are all going to float up in the sky.
That is, until Mum shoots out her hand.
Mum saves the day! She does not go up.
She grabs the bench until the wind stops.
She will be able to get them down.
All of them land safely on the ground.
Bub is still holding the kite.
Is she going to keep interacting with it?
What if a gust of wind comes?
Bub lets go of the spool of string at the end of the kite.
The kite flies on.
Who is the kite going to pick up next?
Tim wants to play with his dad.
His dad says that he must finish all of his homework before they play.
Tim is not done yet.
Time says that his homework is hard to do.
His dad says that he would love to help him.
They will work on letters and sounds.
Tim’s dad asks him which letters and sounds he is finding hard to learn.
Tim says that he finds them all hard because the teacher goes so fast.
Tim’s dad gets out the board that his dad used to use to help him with his homework.
They can write the letters on the board and wipe them off.
He writes the first three letters up on the board.
They say the names of the letters first.
Then they say the sounds that the letters make.
Next they get out the book that Tim uses for school.
Tim’s dad stays beside him as he writes the letters that he sees on the board.
They say the sounds.
Tim just needed to take a bit more time with the letters and sounds.
His dad tells him that it is ok to go slow.
It is better to go slow and soak it all in.
Tim gives his dad a kiss and thanks him.
Now it is time to play ball!
His dad asks the names and sounds of the letters as they play.
Tim gets them all right! He cannot believe it.
Tim wants to play with his dad.
His dad says soon, but that he must do his work first.

It is time to play ball!
Lights are fun!
A spot can be lit up.
But if we had no lights?
It would be no fun.
Light helps us get from spot to spot.
No lights? A big mess!
Light lets us do fun stuff.
It is no fun if the sky is dark.
Lights help us.
It is hard to spot stuff with no lights.
Lights help us to get by.
Yay for lights!
Lights can bring us a lot of joy.
We love to see the lights blink.
Lights in homes wink in the night.
They let us do things when it is dark.
What would it be like if the lights just blinked out one day?
I do not think that we could not play most games or read books at night.
Lights mean that we can all use the roads in a safe way.
If the lights went off, there would be bangs and fights all over town.
Lights can be fun as well!
We can go on rides and see the sights.
If the lights go out, there can be no rides.
My heart would sink.
Lights can keep us safe.
This ship needs light to see where to go.
With no lights, the ship would not know when it had to stop.
When you start to think, you will see that we use lights a lot.
We can learn about lights so that they never have to go out.
Red is on a walk through town.
He is out to find his pal.
The town has a lot of noise.
It does not bring him much joy.
He gets lost in town. It smells of smoke and oil.
There are a lot of cars.
He must watch where he steps.
Now he sees where to go. He walks down the street.
A person points out a horse in the street.
The horse has a cart on the back.
A man is in the cart.
The noise is too much.
He hopes to find his pal soon.
What is that? He knows that hat. Is it his pal?
Yes! It is. His pal brings him joy.
He feels good now.
They walk through town to find a good spot to eat.
Red is on a trip through town.
He lives in a rural spot, so he is not in town very often.
He likes the dogs and bikes.
He does not like the noise.
There is such a lot going on in town all of the time.
Red finds it hard to think.
It is also easy to get lost when you do not spend a lot of time somewhere.
Red does not know which turn to take.
There are a lot of cars in town.
He needs to watch his step.
People are being civil.
There is just a lot going on.
Red sees a signal to walk.
He heads across the road.
He spots something that he knows.
He is headed the right way.
There is a horse in town!
Red likes to be near animals.
He goes closer to the horse so that he can have a look.
The horse has a cart on the back.
A man is in the cart.
Red likes that a lot more than the cars.
He likes things the old way.
He is on the final street to meet his friend now, but the noise gets worse again.
They are fixing the road.
What’s that? He knows that hat.
Is it his friend, or does somebody have the same cap as his mate?
It is his friend! Red is so glad.
Town feels different now that he is not by himself.
It does not seem so bad.
They walk through the town looking for a good place to have a bite to eat.
Red is glad that he came into town to see his friend.
Most fish cannot get out of the water and walk around, but I can.
I am a climbing perch.
I can move between lakes, ponds and swamps.
I like to eat mosquitoes and other insects.
I am a handy thing to have around on a farm because I eat the pests.
I also like to eat insect larvae.
Aside from that, I will snack on small fish and insects in the water, like water fleas.
We have to watch out for some snacks.
When a worm is on a hook like this one, it means that somebody is trying to catch a fish.
As I go around eating all of these yummy foods, I grow and grow.
I become a good swimmer.
My fins become strong as well.
I grow sharp spines along by back.
This will keep me safe if something tries to eat me.
They will think again before trying to bite a climbing perch.
We can make our way into spots that are hard to get to when birds are nearby.
We can climb up the rocks and be out of water for a while.
In parts of the year, the lakes, ponds and swamps that are shallow dry up.
What do you think we will do to find water?
It is hard to find food when the lakebed dries up as well.
How do we get to a new spot and find food over the dry season?
We use our strong fins to get ourselves out of where we have been living and set off to a new spot.
We walk across the land.
This is a good spot. The mud is soft here.
You might find it weird that we have chosen a spot with not a lot of water.
What will we do?
We dig down into the soft mud so that we can sleep until the rain comes back.
When we sleep, we do not need to eat.
Here comes the rain!
We spend the wet season walking between our lakes, ponds and swamps finding yummy snacks to eat.
Climbing perch live all through Southeast Asia.
We can be out of the water for 6 to 10 hours!
Not many fish can do that.
I am not like most fish.
I am a kind of perch that can go up hills.
I like to eat bugs and bug eggs.
It helps out the farmers as well.
I also eat small fish and other animals in the water.
Oh no! Do not eat that worm!
You will be the snack!
As I eat all of these things, I grow and grow.
I grow sharp spines on my back to keep me safe.
Birds fly by with their sharp beaks.
We go up to spots that are hard to get to.
In parts of the year, there is not much rain.
Our lakes, ponds and swamps dry up.
It is hard to find food when the water dries up.
We do not freak out.
We use our strong fins to walk on the land!
We have found the spot! The mud is soft here.
We dig down in the mud so that we can rest until the rain comes.
Here comes the rain!
It is time to walk around and eat.
We are a cool kind of perch that can breathe out of water.
A wasp by a pond.
It zips to and fro to find a snack.
Oh no! A frog got it. ‘Let go!’ it says.
The frog says no.
But the wasp is not the only snack in the pond….
A snake!
The snake grabs the frog for a snack when it is still.
But while the snake got the frog….
a mongoose caught it! ‘Let go!’ says the snake.
The mongoose says no. But here comes….
an eagle! The mongoose still will not let go.
The eagle caught the mongoose on a whim.
Now it has a lot of snacks.
The frog let the wasp go.
It could not think of food at a time like this.
The wasp flew up to the eagle and stung her in the neck.
The eagle let go! It dropped the mongoose.
The mongoose dropped the snake.
The snake dropped the frog.
And they all went in the pond.
They thank the wasp. But while they thank him….
One day, a wasp was travelling around a pond.
It was looking for a snack.
It did not know that it would become a snack itself.
A frog caught it!
‘Let go!’ said the wasp, but the frog would not.
He was looking forward to his insect snack.
It shone like a jewel.
‘You should let go of me now,’ the wasp said, ‘because you need to be on the move.’ ‘Why?’ asked the frog.
Before the frog could do a thing, it got snatched up by a snake!
The snake coiled itself around the frog so that it could not move.
‘Let go,’ said the frog.
‘Why would I do that?’ asked the snake.
‘Because you need to be on the move,’ said the frog.
Is it a weasel? No, it is a mongoose!
A mongoose came out of nowhere and nabbed the snake.
‘Let me go,’ said the snake.
‘Why would I do something like that?’ asked the mongoose.
‘Because we are all about to be lunch!’ said the snake.
Down came the talons of an eagle.
There was no time to move!
‘Let me go!’ said the wasp, but the frog was too scared to do anything.
‘Let me go and I can stop this,’ said the wasp as the eagle took to the skies and brought them all with it.
Now it had snacks! Plural!
The frog did not want its snack anymore.
It let go of the wasp.
The wasp flew up high to the top side of the eagle.
Then, it stung the eagle right in the neck!
The wasp knew that the eagle would have no choice but to….
let go!
The eagle let go of the mongoose and the mongoose started falling down to the ground.
The mongoose was scared. It let go of the snake.
It did not make any difference for the snake though.
She was already falling.
The snake let go of the frog.
There was not much either of them could do to stop the fall, but it seemed silly to hold on to him now.
Splash! The lot of them fell into the pond.
Fish and leaves were thrown up as the water rose up and then settled.
The mongoose, the snake and the frog thanked the wasp.
Now they did not have to be lunch. Unless….
Coach Vic tells us to meet him after school.
He says that he has something cool to show us.
What is it going to be?
Vic has won a lot of awards and other prizes.
Look at the cups and medals that he has in his room.
He is so good at sport.
He shows us a ball for a sport called volleyball!
Vic says that volleyball was the sport that he liked the best when he was young.
Vic has a model of a volleyball field.
He shows us that we need to split into two teams and hit the ball over the net.
We need to jump up high to hit the ball so that it sails over the net.
If the ball lands on the ground, the other team gets a point.
You do not use your feet.
We must try to hit the ball to a tough spot in the court where they will not be able to hit it back.
That is how we get points and win.
Volleyball was first played in America, but now it is played all over the world.
It is a popular sport to play on beaches.
You do not have to have a court.
You can set up a game of volleyball anywhere with a net and a bit of flat ground.
Tim feels like he will not be good at volleyball.
Vic says that he should get out on the court and try.
Plus, you do not have to be really good at something just to have fun.
Vic takes us out to learn.
He told us the rules, and now he is going to show us how to play.
He smashes the ball hard.
He shows us tips and tricks.
We train.
We hit the ball up high so that we will be able to send it over the net when we set up a real game.
My dog chases balls.
I think that he wants to play volleyball as well!
I don't know how high he will be able to punt the ball.
We go to meet Vic when class is done.
He has a gift for us.
Vic has a lot of cups and prizes.
He is so good at sport.
It is a ball for a sport called volleyball!
You use your hands, not your feet.
Vic tells us how to play.
We need to hit the ball over the net.
We need to jump up high to hit the ball.
If it lands, we lose.
We must try to hit the ball to a spot where the other kid will not get it.
Volleyball was first played in America.
If you have a net and flat ground, you can play.
Tim thinks he will not play well.
Vic says he just needs to give it a try.
Vic will show us how to play.
He can teach us moves.
We hit the ball up high!
We must get a feel for it at the start of the game.
My dog wants to play volleyball as well!
I have a lot of great people in my life.
I have pals to play with.
I love my pop.
We ride his bike in the park as we chat.
My nan reads me books.
My pets like to sit by us as she reads.
I have a lot of fun things in my life as well.
I love my toys.
I give thanks for my mind as well.
I have a mind that can think up cool thoughts.
These are not my pets, but it makes my chest swell when I see animals.
I am glad that I have a mum and dad.
They help me with so much.
I love to spend time with my uncle in the yard.
I have a lot of plants in my life.
My brother can be more like a child than I am, but I still love him.
Last of all, I am thankful for my sister.
There is so much that I love in my life.
We have had a lot of rain this week.
Now the sun is out.
It is a fine day, and there is the right amount of wind to go and fly my kite.
I look down my street and see all kinds of kites in the air.
One has a monster on it. One has a fish.
I made my kite look cool too.
When I made my kite, I had to make sure that it was the right length and height.
If the sides were not even, the kite would not stay in the sky.
I made my kite from some sketches so that I would know the size of what I needed to cut out.
I cut the shape out of paper so that the kite would be light.
Then I had to buy a long bit of string for my kite.
It stretches really far! It was fun to play with.
I ran around the house as it trailed behind me.
Then I went up to the roof and let my kite loose in the wind!
Do you like what I drew on the front?
It is a troll queen!
At first it loses height, but then my kite soars up over the houses on my street.
I hope that it can make it up as high as the other kites that are in the sky.
If you want to make your own kite at home, you will need to have a plan.
Look up the right shape first.
Then you need some paper, bits of dowel and some string.
Give it a try!
It is a fine day to fly my kite.
The wind is just right.
I can see kites all down my street!
A lot of kids had the same thought.
When you make a kite, both sides have to be the same length.
I made a plan, then cut the shape of my kite out of paper.
I also had to get a long bit of string to make my kite.
I got up on the roof and set my kite free in the wind!
My kite goes up over the homes and trees.
You can make your own kite at home! Give it a try.
Drip, drop.
A little bit of rain has started to fall.
She loves the rainy season.
It helps all of the plants to grow.
They get out some big buckets so that they can store the water for later.
They can use it to bathe and cook.
If they boil it, they can drink it.
Rain compels her mum to sing.
She brings out her sitar and starts to play.
The song sounds lovely with the rain in the background.
As the pupils run home from school, they see birds in the rain.
Some birds like the rain.
They hang off branches and play.
These birds do not.
When they get home, they wash and change.
They can smell what their mum is cooking for dinner.
It is a nice, warm meal for a rainy day.
She loves to go out after the rain and see the drops that cling to leaves and petals.
It looks like the whole world has had a big drink.
This is her favourite tree.
It grows a lot during the rainy season.
The rain helps it to stay in good health when the dry season comes around.
This is Crow. He likes to sing.
He lands by a rabbit, a newt and a rooster.
He sings for them. It gives them pangs of pain.
Crow fills his lungs and sings more.
They do not like his song. They leave.
Crow will find a spot to sing on his own.
He flies up into a tree.
He hops from branch to branch.
What can he spy down there? Is it a box?
No, it is a bench. It is a spot to sing!
Crow sets up his spot. They want to see.
Crow tells the rooster to give it a try.
Then the newt has a go.
The rabbit sings while on the drums.
There is a throng of singers. Crow sings as well.
Crow is in a band!
He is glad that he can share his songs.
This rooster was not wanted on its farm.
They left it in town.
The farmer said not to come back.
He must find a new home.
A man takes the rooster in.
He puts screws in logs to make a bowl.
He gives the rooster corn.
The rooster wakes up.
There are bad men trying to get into the house!
He spews out a loud sound. He gives it his all.
It wakes up the man and his wife.
They come out and see the men.
A few friends do as well. They call the cops.
The cops catch the men and take them to jail.
They will pay.
The man and his wife thank the rooster.
He will have a home with them for good.
This rooster has been left in town.
He used to live on a farm.
The farmer did not want him there anymore.
The rooster is not feeling upbeat.
People are not kind to him. He tries to find food.
They chase him away.
A man and his wife let the rooster come to stay on their farm.
They make him his own bowl and give him corn.
One night, the rooster sees bad men going in upstairs.
They want to steal from his new family.
The rooster makes quite an uproar.
He crows loud enough for the whole town to hear.
The man and his wife wake up.
They come outside to see what the fuss is.
Some of their friends come out as well.
They see the bad men trying to break in.
The cops come and catch the men.
They put them in jail.
They are not going to be able to steal from anybody in the town.
The man and his wife thank the rooster.
He is a real upgrade to the farm.
They will always have a place for him in their house.
I have so many people in my life that I care about.
This is one of my pals, Jen.
We make up fun games to play on the weekends.
I love to ride bikes in the park with my grandad.
Sometimes we each take our own bikes.
Sometimes we just ride on one.
My nan loves to read me stories.
She does not mind if I want to read the same ones again and again.
The pets like to sit and listen as well.
I also have a lot of things in my life that I love.
I am so lucky to have cool toys.
Some kids do not get to have many toys.
I also need to be thankful for my mind.
It is easy to forget how lucky we are to be in good health.
My mind helps me make sense of the world and think up new things.
These are not my pets, but it makes me happy when I see animals.
I am glad that there are animals in the world.
I am so glad that I have a mum and dad to help me get through everything in my day.
I do not always think to say thank you to them.
I also love to spend time in the yard with my uncle.
He shows me how to grow plants.
I am lucky to have a backyard where I can play.
My brother can be a little bit annoying at times, but I still love him.
He shares his toys with me and shows me when he finds cool bugs that I will like.
Last but not least, I am thankful for my sister.
She teaches me how to read and make papercraft.
I have a lot that I love in my life.
Tina does not like to do her jobs.
It makes her mum mad.
Tina sings a tune as she works.
It makes the work more fun.
She hears a new song.
She finds an elf in the corn!
The elf likes her tune.
The elf can go jobs in a flash!
Then there is a lot of time for fun!
But that night, the elf left her house.
Tina had to find the elf so that she could do her jobs.
Tina went through the corn field the next day, but the elf was not there.
She wept.
She made a wish to find the elf, but it did not come true.
She went home in the dark.
One day, the corn jumped off their stalks and into her basket.
Tina felt a rush.
The elf was back!
Tina was so glad that she had come to help her work.
Tina gave the elf a hug and told her of her plans for their day.
The elf did not want to do jobs.
Tina got it. She could do them herself.
She and the elf could just hang out and sing.
Tina has a lot of jobs to do each day.
She just wants to play. Her mum tells her that.
she needs to finish her work before she can have fun.
She likes to sing as she works.
It makes her jobs a bit less of a chore.
Tina makes up her own songs about what she is doing.
She hears somebody singing her song back to her.
She goes into the field of corn to look for them.
She sees an elf sitting on an ear of corn.
The elf can do a number of Tina's jobs in a flash.
The elf helps her get some water to do the dishes.
When they are done, they go outside and play.
When Tina woke up in the night, she saw that the elf was not there.
She took the blanket off of her bed and looked around her room, but it was no use.
The elf had left.
Tina went through the whole field of corn the next day.
She did not get her jobs done, and she did not find the elf either.
She tried wishing for the elf to come back, but that did not work either.
When it got dark, she had to go home and face her mum.
One day when Tina went out to pick corn, the cobs jumped off their stalks and landed right in her basket like it was a magnet.
It saved a lot of time.
The elf was back! Tina could not believe her luck.
Now she would not have to do as much work.
They could have fun instead!
Tina gave the elf a hug and told her how much she was missed.
Then she told the elf all of the chores that she needed help with.
The elf told Tina that she did not want to do all of her jobs.
Tina got it. She said sorry to the elf.
She could do her own chores.
They could just hang out as friends and sing.
The elf was glad.
These are not oak trees. We live on a mango farm.
It is time to pick them.
The mango trees are tall.
We need to go up the trees and pluck the fruit.
We do not moan and groan while we pick.
It is fun to work as a team.
We get to eat the mangoes while we work.
Gran chops them up for us.
Our pals come to help.
We will give them some mangoes to take home.
We get the mangoes down and sort them on our rug.
Then we load them in the car.
Dad takes the mangoes to town.
We set up a tent and sell them.
We swap some of our mangoes as well.
We float out on our boat to swap them for other fruit.
Yum! I love life on our mango farm.
I have socks in every colour.
They have spots, frills and cool stitches.
I have washed my socks so that I am ready for the week.
I keep all of my socks in a big box under my bed.
I keep my best pair in this small box.
I only wear them on special days.
Oh no! My best pair of socks is missing!
I get on my cap and some socks so that I can look around the house for the lost pair.
My best pair of socks is pink.
They have purple on them as well.
The purple is on the frills, spots, toes and heels.
I get my looking glass.
I look for my socks on the couches.
I look under the table.
I even look to see if they are in the toilet!
Just when I start to lose hope, I come across a scrap of fabric that is the same as my socks!
Has my best pair of socks been cut up?
I open the door to where mum stitches and patches clothes.
I can hear her sewing in there.
What is she making?
Mum said that my socks had too many holes in them.
She knows how much I love those socks, so she made them into a doll!
She passes me the doll.
She has given the doll the same hair and hat as me.
She has even kept the sock’s frills as the collar for the doll’s dress!
This is such a cool thing to do with socks when they are too old to use anymore!
I tell mum that I want to make more sock dolls.
I drag Mum around the house as we look for more socks that we can use.
We check to see if Dad has any worn out ones.
Dad’s socks are so big that we can make more than one doll per sock!
Mum and I will make some dolls for my friends.
I love my socks. They make my feet look cute.
I put them all back in a big box by my bed when they are clean.
I put my best socks in the small box.
They are gone!
I will find them. They have spots and frills.
I hunt all through the house.
No socks here or there. Bad luck.
I find a scrap of cloth!
It is the same as my sock!
Is my sock in this room? Did it get cut up?
Mum says the sock was old. It had holes.
She made it into a doll!
She hands me the doll.
She kept the frills and all!
It was my best sock, but now it is my best doll!
I want to make more dolls from old socks.
Mum shows me how to make a sock doll.
Here are some birds. Birds are reptiles.
All birds have wings, and most of them can fly.
Birds can fly quite far.
This means that they do not have to stay in cold spots where there is not much food.
Dragonflies can fly any way that they wish.
They can go forwards and backwards or side to side.
They can even hover in one spot.
Butterflies have big wings that they can use to soar on the breeze.
If they are floating on the wind, it can save them some energy.
Is there anything that doesn’t have wings that can still be up in the sky?
See if you can think of any before you turn the page.
Clouds float up in the sky.
Clouds are a big part of our weather systems.
They carry water from one spot to another.
If you put a kite up in the right spot, it can stay in the sky for a long time.
Have you ever put a kite up into the sky?
But what about us?
Is there any way that we can take to the skies and see what the birds and bugs can?
Can we soar up with the kites and clouds?
We are not birds. We do not have wings.
Bats are the only mammals with wings.
Are we able to get up into the sky and fly?
We are not clouds.
We cannot form in the sky and take water across the land.
We would fall right out of the sky.
We are not kites.
We cannot soar up into the sky and stay there if we catch a good breeze, unless we have a glider.
We need other things to help us fly, like planes and rockets.
Or we can use our minds and dream about what it would be like up there.
Here is a bird. It can fly up in the sky.
It can head to new spots.
Some bugs can fly.
These bugs can beat their wings hard so that they do not drift.
Some bugs have big wings that they use to float on the breeze.
Are there things with no wings that can still be up in the sky?
Yes. Clouds can float up in the sky.
They form up there.
Kites can float up in the sky if you put them up in spots with wind.
We are not birds nor bugs.
We are not clouds nor kites.
Can beasts that do not have wings still get up into the sky and fly?
We are not clouds.
We do not float if we are up in the sky.
We are not kites.
We cannot spread out and drift on the breeze.
We can use planes, or we can put our heads to the test and fly in our minds.
This is a crow. Crows like to make noise.
They make a ‘haw’ sound that can be heard from a long way off.
This crow looks tired.
Has it been on a long flight?
It has come from far off.
The crow wants to make friends in this new spot.
It sees a rabbit, a rooster and a lizard.
How will it start friendships with them?
The crow sings for his new friends.
They are not fans of how he sounds.
They like the quiet. The crow makes a big hubbub.
They ask him to stop, but he cannot hear them over the sound of his own song.
Crow loves to belt out a tune as loud as he can.
The animals run off.
Crow sings as loud as a boombox as they flee.
He feels like they must not have heard the song that he is singing just for them.
His new friends are gone.
No matter, Crow will just find a new spot to sing by himself.
He can get really good for next time he sees his friends.
He flits from branch to branch looking for the best spot to perch.
Where will his song catch on the breeze just right so that it goes as far as it can?
Crow is in the treetops all by himself now.
All of his new friends went to a quiet part of the woods.
But what is this?
It might just look like a bench to most animals, but to Crow it looks like a place to stand and sing!
He can use it to bring his songs to the world.
Crow sets up the microphone on the small stage.
The animals come to see what the crow is doing.
They have not seen a microphone before.
The crow tells the rooster to give it a try.
The rooster bursts into song.
He did not know that he liked to sing so much.
Next is the lizard.
She sings a soft tune at first.
The crow gives him praise.
The lizard sings a bit louder.
Soon she is belting out a song like a rockstar.
Then it is time for the rabbit to give things a try.
She is great at singing, and she can play the drums at the same time!
All three of them want to hear the crow sing again.
He has found a way to share what he loves to do.
Crows are so smart.
The animals have started a band!
The crow is glad that he tried making friends with his new pals in a way that they all could enjoy.
Tiger does not have any pals, but she likes it that way.
She likes the peace and quiet.
She likes to spend time by herself.
A mouse tries to make friends with the tiger, but it can see the fiendish look in her eye.
She is not above eating a mouse as a snack.
Tiger has caught a deer for her lunch.
She does not like to share.
Tigers do not even live with other tigers.
They like to live alone.
Monkeys and birds call out to their pals when they see those greenish eyes.
They know that she is to be left alone.
They want their friends to be safe.
All animals flee when Tiger comes around.
She does not mind.
She does not want to be friends with such noisy things.
When Tiger stalks their way, the birds stay in tallish trees.
Here a stag calls to warn other deer that the tiger is near.
What's this? Nobody is here?
Tiger thought she heard something.
She feels a little foolish.
Oh well, at least she has her peace and quiet.
Tiger has no pals, but that is how she likes it.
She feels calm on her own.
A mouse tries to make friends, but it can see a look in Tiger’s eye.
The chief thing about Tiger is that she does not like to share.
No pals, no sharing.
A monkey cries out to its friend as Tiger goes by.
It tells its pal to hide.
They all run when Tiger comes. She does not care.
She is not in need of a pal.
The stag calls out.
He tries to tell the deer that are near to flee.
It works.
In a brief moment, they are all gone!
No snacks, but at least all is quiet.
In a brief moment, they are all gone!
No snacks, but at least all is quiet.
She would really like a drink.
There are no taps in her house.
She needs to get water from outside.
There has not been any rain in a while.
She tips up the pail that she uses to fetch water.
It only has one drop left.
She will have to go for a walk to find more.
First she tries the pump, which is fed from a well that is close to her house.
The pump is dry.
She will need to look somewhere else.
She goes and tries the tank.
The tank can store a lot of water when it rains.
She turns the tap to find that there is none left.
She goes to the creek, but the bed is dry.
The trees needed to suck up all of the water so that they could to get through the dry season.
She walks a long way to get to the dam.
When she gets there, she is stunned.
The dam is dry as well. It is a bad season.
She lives near the sea, but she knows that she cannot drink that water.
It has too much salt.
Drinking seawater would make her sick.
She spots one, dark cloud above her.
She knows that it is no use to get upset, but she yells at the cloud for not bringing rain.
More clouds join the first one.
There are flashes of light and big bangs.
She runs home again and hides until the storm is over.
When the sun comes out the next day, she walks out to see that the well, creek, tank and dam have all been filled!
Time to have a drink.
She wants a drink.
There has not been rain in a while.
Is there any water in the pail?
There is just a drop.
She goes to the pump. The pump is fed from a well.
It is dry.
She goes to the tank and turns the tap. No luck.
She tries the river. The trees drank it all.
It is so dry.
She walks to the dam. That is dry as well.
Where will she get a drink?
She lives by the sea, but that water has too much salt for her to drink it.
There is one, dark cloud in the dry. She is mad.
She yells at it for not raining.
More clouds come. It storms.
She goes home and hides from the big bangs.
When the sun comes out the next day, she sees that there is a lot to drink!
Drip, drop. She loves to stand in the rain.
She puts up her arms and grins.
They put out some pails to catch the rain.
They can use it.
Her mum likes to stay in the house when it rains.
She plays a tune and sings.
The birds are not fans of the rain.
They put up their tails to try to keep the rain off.
They get home and get dry.
The smells from dinner trail into the living room.
All of the plants will be so green.
She loves to see how much things grow from the rain.
She is a big fan of this tree.
The rain helps it to grow up big and strong.
Paul likes to draw.
He sketches every day when he comes home from school.
His mum buys him big art books to draw in.
Paul starts with three shapes.
He draws a larger circle with two smaller circles above it.
It is fun to guess what a drawing will be.
He can always think of something cool to draw.
He fishes things out of his mind. What is this?
Has he drawn two eyes?
He fills in the big circle. Paul is very neat.
He does not go out of the lines.
It is hard to do, but he keeps his hand still as he works.
Now he is drawing a box to the side of the other shapes.
Is this going to be a car? A car with eyes?
Or is it a living thing?
I think it is a living thing.
Paul has drawn legs with feet.
Each leg matches the other.
He is very good at drawing things the same height and width.
He searches a picture up on his laptop to check something.
Now there is a smile coming off the big, black circle.
What kind of animals have a smile like that?
Is it a cat?
Paul wants to know if we can guess what he has drawn.
He says that he has one more thing to add that will help us to guess.
A tail! It sticks up.
I think that this is the sort of tail that wags when an animal is glad.
What kind of animal does that?
Yes! Paul has drawn a dog. It is such a cute dog!
I like the lines that he drew to show the fur.
It makes the dog look soft.
You can draw your own dog, just like Paul did!
Follow the steps in this book.
You might like to make your own animals out of shapes as well!
Paul wants to draw. He saw his art pad in here.
There it is!
He draws three shapes.
Two small dots and one big one.
Here are two more shapes. Dots in dots!
Are they eyes?
Paul fills in the big dot. He stays in the lines.
Is it a nose?
We are in for the long haul!
He draws a box to the side.
The box gets four legs with feet.
Will Paul draw a cat?
The big, black dot gets a smile.
What has Paul drawn?
He wants us to tell him what we think it is.
What do you think?
Oh! A small tail at the end. The tail is up.
What has a tail that goes up?
A dog! Paul has drawn lines for fur.
The dog is so cute!
You can have a go!
Try to draw this dog like Paul did.
Kojo has a test at school this week.
The class is doing a unit on reading.
Kojo is doing his homework so that he will do well on the test.
The first word is ‘grandad’.
This grandad has a bucket hat and a cup of tea.
He is in a grey coat and a yellow shirt.
The next word that Kojo can spy is ‘grandma’.
This grandma has bright clothes.
She has a headscarf.
She is wearing a string of pearls.
Now Kojo can spy the word ‘hen’.
The hen is in a headscarf too!
Where did it get a scarf like that?
Kojo reads the word ‘cat’. That is easy for him.
The cat has a necktie on like it is off to work.
Kojo’s dad has a necktie like that.
Kojo comes across a hard word.
He is frozen for a moment.
He breaks the word down into parts.
The word is monkey! Kojo adds it to his word bank.
The monkey has a silk vest on.
It looks very smart in its vest.
Kojo feels like he is going to do well on his test.
He reads every day.
Reading on a regular basis is the only way to get better.
Kojo has a lot of terms in his word bank now, but he wants to see what else he can spy.
What words are on his radar?
Hank has a test at school.
He does not want to flunk it.
He must read.
He reads the word dad Dad has some tea.
Hank can spy the word ‘mum’. Mum has a scarf.
Hank reads the word ‘hen’.
The hen has a scarf too!
Hank can spy the word ‘cat’. The cat has a tie.
This is a hard word. Hank links the sounds.
Monkey! Hank adds it to his word bank.
Hank will do well on the test.
He can read a lot of words.
Hank wants to spy more words to read.
Here is Don. He is out for a day with his family.
When they go to the shops, they each get to choose something to buy.
His brother chooses some star glasses.
His sister chooses a lollipop.
Don chooses a blue cap that he can wear in the park.
At the park, the wind sweeps the cap off his head.
He stretches out and nearly catches it before it sails on the breeze ahead of him.
The cap lands high up in a tree.
Don fetches a small rock and tries to peg it at the hat to bring it down, but it does not work.
He starts to cry and he cannot stop.
His new cap was so cool.
Now it will be stuck in the tree for good and he will have to watch it get old and dirty.
He can see the cap from his window.
Just when he is thinking that he might get the broom and try to poke it free, the moon comes up.
The moon catches his hat!
He can see a smile on the moon.
Don tells the moon that the cap is its to enjoy.
Don’s mum gets him a new cap. This one is red.
He cannot wait until the moon is in the right spot for him to show it his new cap.
Don rushes out when the moon is on the rise.
They are cap buddies now!
Don hopes that the cap never falls out of the tree.
The next day, Don cannot help but think about the sun.
Does the sun want to have its own cap too?
I make my own puppets. I make them nonstop!
I stand behind and pull the twine.
I like to have different kinds so that I can change up the stories in my show.
I give each of my puppets different clothes so that people can tell what kind of lives they have.
This one is a rich lady.
I can draw backgrounds with nonhuman parts so that my puppets can act in front of them.
Here she can be friends with a tiger and tell us about plants.
I can pull the twine to get this puppet to teach us about germs.
She can tell us about what is nonsense and what is true.
I make my puppets using fabric and card.
The card helps them to stand up straight.
The fabric makes them look nice.
I love to put shows on for friends and family.
I get to show off my talents while they have a great time.
It feels good to make them smile.
I make my own puppets.
I hide at the back while I pull the twine.
I can lift up their arms and make them wave.
She will show us the stars in the sky.
I can get her to bend down to check on the ferns as the tiger keeps watch.
Wow!
I can get this puppet to show us things about germs on her board.
This is how I make my own puppets.
I make them with card, twine and cloth.
I love to put on a show with my puppets.
It feels good to have done it all myself.
The boy in the purple shirt is Don.
He is at the shops.
He does not want a toy. He wants a cap!
The wind gets the hat.
He tries to catch up with it.
The hat is at the top of the tree.
It foils his plan.
Don is so sad. He will not eat.
He can only think of the cap.
Don can see it from his room.
Will it spoil his night?
No! The moon comes by. It puts on the hat.
It makes Don grin.
Don gets a new hat from his mum. It is a red cap.
Don and the moon are the same now.
They are cap buds.
Don thinks of the sun. Does it need a cap?
This boy has a rock and a feather.
He wants to do some tests.
The rock has more mass than the feather.
It drops to the ground faster.
A rock is strong.
It was made over a long time through heat and pressure.
It can keep its shape when it is in a tight grip.
A rock is a bit like an elephant.
Both are high in mass and stay on the spot if they are big.
He cannot move this elephant an inch.
A feather is a lot lighter than a rock.
It is soft and can float in the breeze.
It does not take much for a feather to lose its shape.
Now he wants to know how much the rock weighs.
How can he do that?
It can be hard to forecast how much something weighs just from picking it up.
He asks his dad how he can find out the weight of the rock.
His dad brings out a set of scales.
That is the right tool for the job!
His dad finds a flask and fills it with water until it weighs one kilogram.
Now they can use the flask on the scales to weigh the rock.
Sometimes you can have a lot less of something but it can still weight more.
Ten cows are going to weigh a lot more than 200 dogs!
The scales will tip.
The world is too big for a set of scales.
Can we still find a way to know how heavy it is?
Yes, we can use maths to find out the mass.
We can use the size of the Earth to find out how much it weighs.
We can also find out its weight from how dense it is and gravity.
Look at how many feathers it takes for the scales to be even with our one kilogram flask.
There is such a difference in the space that the two sides take up.
Raindrops are light, but when they come together they can make something very heavy: the sea!
Mass is fun to think about.
He weighs more than the watermelon but less than the elephant.
When we know the mass of something, we can guess other things about it as well.
It helps us make sense of our world.
They have a rock and a feather.
The rock has more mass than the feather.
A rock is strong.
It will not shift in shape when it gets a big squeeze.
An elephant is strong as well.
It takes a lot to make it move.
A feather is so light.
He curls his hand so that the wind does not pick it up.
He wants to find out how much the rock weighs.
How can he do that?
His dad has a set of scales!
That is the best way to find out the weight of the rock.
His dad fills up a flask so that it is the same as one kilogram.
Here are 10 cows and 200 dogs.
Which way will the scales tilt? To the cows.
The world has a lot of mass.
There are no scales that big.
We would need a lot of flasks to make up this mass.
Hey, look!
It takes a lot of feathers to get to one kilogram.
Check out the pile!
Drops of water are light, but they flow together to make the sea.
He can find out his own mass as well!
Pat the cat does not have a home.
Most of the time he does not mind.
He naps in a tree that he likes and gets food from the Jones family.
What is this?
The Jones family are going on a trip?
Pat will not have any food put out for him.
The reality hits him.
Pat knows that there is a lot of food in the Jones house.
He get in through a window to see what he can find.
Lucky the Jones family do not have a security alarm.
There is a string of bags. What is inside?
Pat scratches and bites at the bags to open them.
And then….
Bang! The chips burst out.
He thinks that they are good quality.
They taste great! Pat eats all of them.
Pat goes on desks and in bins.
He finds treats here and there.
He eats bread, meat and spreads.
One day, Pat finds that he can open the fridge.
That is the best day.
There is cheese, milk and cold cuts.
Pat ate it all.
He did not know the last time that he could have as much food as he liked.
He had been on the street a long time.
Pat got fat. He started to feel a bit sick.
Even so, he still wanted to find more food to eat.
He could not stop.
Pat had no vanity about the way that he looked.
He did not mind being a fat cat if he felt full.
He cleared out the fridge.
But when the Jones family came back, Pat found that he could not get out of the window.
He wanted to get up into his tree, but he was too fat.
When the Jones family got inside, they thought that there might have been a thief!
There was such a mess all over the house.
But then.
they saw Pat. They felt for him.
They did not know that he had no home.
They just thought that he liked it in his tree.
The Jones family took Pat in.
They looked after him.
They washed him and brushed him They gave him the right amount of food.
Pat loves being in the Jones family.
And he still has his tree.
Pat the Cat is in a tree.
He does not like to catch prey.
Pat gets food from the Jones family.
But they are off on a trip.
Pat will have to find food.
He goes into the Jones house.
Bags of chips! They are all in a line.
Pat swipes at them.
Hey! He is eating all of the chips!
That is too much.
Pat finds bits of food on desks and in bins.
Then he gets the fridge open.
It is so good, he will have food for days!
Hey, Pat! That is a lot of food!
You will get sick.
Pat is fat. He does not look well.
But he still wants more.
Pat has had all of the food in the whole house.
He wants to go out to his tree, but he is too fat to get out!
The Jones family is home! They see a big mess.
Then they see Pat.
They feel bad for Pat. He does not have a home.
They take Pat in. They will take care of him.
He is Pat Jones now.
I live on a farm with a lot of animals.
There is a big, green frog that can spot the rooster on our roof.
The rooster can spot me.
I can spot a man that is off to town.
Will he go to the shops to get some food for the week, or is he off to post a letter?
The man spots a big cow by the side of the road.
The cow is munching on the lush grass.
It must taste good.
The cow spots a bird up in the sky.
What does it think of the bird?
I wonder if the cow would like to fly?
Birds fly all over the town.
They can spot a lot of things.
This one spots a cat. It had better keep back.
The cat looks down and sees me.
I am coming back from school.
I like to chat to kids that I see on my way home for supper.
When it is night, I spot a firefly.
I love to see fireflies glow in the dark.
They look like the stars in the sky.
I feel like the firefly is looking up at the stars.
Is it wondering if the stars are fireflies?
The stars look down on us all.
There are so many stars in the night sky.
It occurs to me that they are all suns.
Many of them have planets.
Is somebody on a planet looking back at us?
I think of what a being on one of those planets might look like.
Do they have a farm?
Do they have their own animals and crops?
We head off to bed.
When we close our eyes, we cannot spot anything.
Maybe we will dream of the things that we spotted through the day.
A lot of things live on a farm.
The rooster spots me.
I spot a man.
He may be off to town to get his mail.
The man spots a big cow by the side of the road.
The cow strays from its field. It spots a bird.
The bird does not fail to spot a cat.
The cat looks down and spots me.
I spot a bug that can glow in the night.
The bug can spot the stars up in the sky.
The stars can spot us all. They are up so high.
There are so many stars in the sky that I lose count.
We all go to sleep. We do not spot a thing.
Has Kit gotten out of the house again?
I will look by the gate to see if she is on the footpath.
Maybe she went for a walk.
Oh, Kit must not have come out here.
I thought I heard her meow? Where could Kit be?
Is she in a good hiding spot?
I see her sleeping on top of this big, blue pot all of the time, but not today.
How odd. Is she being sneaky, like a tiger?
She is not behind the pot.
Now I am starting to freak out.
Kit is not in any of her main spots.
Where could she be?
I walk to the back of the house and search a bush.
Maybe she hid in there. It is no use.
She is not there either.
I hear a meow! I go to the front of the house.
No, not here? My cat radar is really off today.
I cannot spot her at all.
Maybe she is back inside.
I head to my bedroom and look under my cupboard.
She is small enough to fit, but she is not there.
I get a stool and stand on top of it so that I can see up high.
No, Kit is not even on top of the cupboard.
I am having no luck today.
I look on my bookshelf and around my toys.
Sometimes Kit will sit there, but not very often.
I am really worried now.
Maybe I should look under my bed.
Kit loves to sleep there. It is warm and safe.
I crouch down so that I can have a look.
She is not under there.
Maybe my cat radar is broken?
I am all out of places that she might be.
I will have to call Mum for help.
Wait! There is a bump under the blanket!
I lift up a side and see Kit in there.
She must have been in there the whole time.
I am so glad that I have found her.
Did Kit get out of the house?
Shall I look by the gate?
Oh, Kit is not here.
Did she walk off down the street?
Kit likes to sit on top of this big pot.
She is not here.
She is not by the shrubs at the back.
I go to the back of the house and look in a bush.
I go to the front of the house when I think I hear a mew.
Hush!
I go back in the house. I look down low.
I look on top of the cupboard. I shake my head.
No Kit.
I look in my books and toys. Kit is not there.
My bed? Kit loves my bed. I she under it?
She is not there. Just where can she be?
Wait, there she is! Under the blanket.
She must have been there the whole time.
Spike the cactus had no pals.
He jumped over to a group of trees to see if they wanted to be friends.
They laughed and told him to beat it.
Spike did not mind.
It was only one group of trees.
There are plenty of plants out there to be pals with.
He moved on.
Spike saw an orange tree.
He hopped over there in his pot.
He asked the orange tree if it needed a friend.
It was a grumpy old thing. It said no.
Spike went up to a banana tree.
It was scared of him and asked him to leave.
He did not know why. He let the banana tree be.
Next he tried a mango tree and a guava.
They let out long sighs.
Spike was feeling a bit sad, but he kept on his search.
Spike was running out of plants in the garden to be pals with.
He went up to the pawpaw tree.
The pawpaw said he had heard that Spike was looking for a pal.
The pawpaw tree said that they could hang out.
The pawpaw did not want to be biased because other people had not been friends with the cactus.
But when they were chatting, Spike hurt the pawpaw tree by mistake.
The pawpaw did not react well.
Was this why it was hard to find friends?
The pawpaw pulled back and told Spike to go find a friend that he would not hurt.
He tried to say sorry, but the pawpaw would not hear it.
Spike did not know what to do.
There were no spikey plants in the garden, but he was tired of being by himself.
He left to find a new spot.
Spike went across the road and out to the dunes.
He found that he liked it out there.
He did not need much fluid, so he felt good in a dry spot.
He also found a bush that was covered in thorns!
The new pals got on well.
Spike left his pot by the road, and they set out into the dunes.
They sang duets and told stories as they explored the dunes.
For the first time, Spike grew flowers.
It is a rainy day!
What are we going to do with it?
I want to head outside for a bit so that we can feel fresh and relax in the rain.
We can find puddles so that we can make a big splash!
It is fun to jump up and down in puddles when it begins to rain.
We can go down to the pond and swim with the frogs.
I take off my gumboots so that I can squelch my feet in the wet grass and the mud.
I can lay out and let the rain drip on me.
It feels nice as the drops fall down on my skin.
The world smells so crisp when it rains.
If it gets too crazy out there, we can find a spot to hide while it pelts down.
We can grab a big leaf and walk while we are undercover.
I make a hot drink to warm me up when I get home.
I think they should have some too, on the basis that they are also cold.
I tell them that coffee is not good for animals.
That does not stop them trying though.
The animals like to sit around while I read my book.
I read out aloud so that they can hear my voice.
They like the sound of it.
It is fun to sing in the rain.
I like how our singing sounds against the rain in the background.
The rain is like a backing track.
We stay up late into the night as the storm keeps on.
I share stories with my animals.
They listen to me with keen ears.
The sun is up!
After all of that rain, it will be a great day for plants to drink in the sun and grow strong.
Time to get to work.
Spike had no pals.
He went up to some trees to say hi.
They wanted to start a fight.
Some trees are rude. Spike did not mind.
He went off to find a plant pal.
He went up to an orange tree to ask if it needed a friend.
It said it did not.
He tried a banana tree. It was scared of him.
He let it be.
Next, he tried a mango tree. Then a guava.
They let out big sighs.
He made his way to a pawpaw.
The pawpaw had heard that Spike might ask to be pals.
The pawpaw felt bad for him.
He said that they could be pals.
But when they were jumping off to play, Spike hurt the pawpaw by mistake.
The pawpaw told him to go and find a spikey friend.
Spike looked high and low, but there were no spikey plants in the garden.
He left.
He went out to the dunes.
There was a bush by itself.
It had thorns all over!
Spike left his pot behind and went out to live in the dunes with his new pal.
It is time to pick the mangoes on our farm!
If we do not pick them in time, the insects will get to them.
We have a lot of mango trees.
We need to work hard to pluck them all while they are ripe.
This is how we make our money.
We scale the trees and pick the mangoes one by one.
Gran is too old to go up the trees now, but she makes sure that we are safe.
We have a mango picnic for lunch.
Gran has cut them up for us.
I like to chew on the skin and the seed as well.
Back to work. Our friends come to help.
We will send some mangoes home with them in a basket as a thank you.
We load the mangoes into baskets and send them down.
Then we sort them on a blanket.
We will sell some for cheap and some for more money.
Dad packs the mangoes up in the truck and we drive down to the market.
We put out our blanket and start to sell them.
We also load them in our boat and float out onto the river.
We swap our mangoes for other kinds of fruit.
I love mangoes.
It is hard work to pick and sell them, but it is worth it.
I want to be a farmer just like Dad and Gran.
Wheels are on a lot of things.
They make them tick.
Some wheels are small and some wheels are big!
Clocks have wheels in them.
They make them tick and tock.
We see a lot of wheels when we go to farms and work sites.
It clicks just how many wheels we use.
There are wheels all over the world in in trains, fans and toys.
But what if we had no wheels? How would we get by?
There are a lot of things that we could not make with no wheels.
We would have to make things by hand.
We would move goods on animals.
It might sound fun, but it can be hard to work with animals.
We would have to go back to the old ways with boats and carts.
We would miss out on some things, but not all.
And with no wheels, we would have no smog!
Which life would you like?
To stick with wheels or get rid of them?
Vines are plants that can creep up and to the side.
They can be long.
Vines can go up a tree or some down a branch.
They can hold on.
A vine can have fruit and flowers.
The fruit grows where the flowers drop off.
We can plant a vine to go over a house or an arch.
They are keen to grow up!
Some trees have vines all over.
The vines can go up steep spots.
Some vines hold on with these small curls.
The curls twist onto a frame.
Vines can fork out so that they go both ways.
They can tuck into small spots.
Vines on a farm.
They are not tall, but they spread out.
Some vines grow food in the soil.
The green leaves get the sun for the parts under the ground.
Vines can go wild!
They are keen plants that can grow very fast.
There are a lot of kinds of vines.
See if you can spot some where you live.
Frog loves to look up at the stars.
He loves their neon glow.
He wants to find a way that he can get up close to them.
Frog tries reaching out to the stars.
They are much too high up.
He will never reach them with his short arms.
Frog goes to a hill and tries to reach the stars from there.
It is no use. The stars are still far too high up.
Frog can see a palm tree.
A giant palm tree will get him quite high up.
He has not gone all the way up a tree before, but he will try.
Frog starts to climb up the tree.
He is a bit scared, but he really wants to be able to get to the stars.
He keeps at it.
Frog is at the top!
He reaches out one of his hands.
He still can’t reach the stars!
Why are they so far away?
Now he has a problem.
He has to find a way out of the tree.
This has ruined his night a little.
He cannot climb down.
Frog takes in a big breath. He makes himself calm.
He will have to be as brave as a lion and jump out of the giant palm tree.
He peers down into the pond at the bottom of the palm tree.
He sees something shine. Is it bugs?
Frog jumps down.
He puts his arms out in front of him.
As he falls through the air, he feels like he can see the stars!
Yes! He can see the stars.
They are shining in the pond. He is so close now!
Closer than he ever was to reaching them in the sky.
Splash! His night is not ruined after all.
Frog has found a star pond.
He will be able to spend all night sitting with the stars.
Frog is pleased.
They may not be the stars in the sky, but they are all the stars that he needs.
And after his big jump down, he does not want to go to the sky anyway.
Frog decides that this will be his new home so that he can look down into the stars every night.
Frog sits in his pond looking at the stars.
He loves the view.
He wants to touch the stars, but they are too high up.
Frog went up a big hill.
He still could not touch the stars.
He saw a tree. It made him think.
Would that be high enough?
Frog went up the tree. It took a long time.
He is only small.
He put out his hand, but it was no use.
They were still too far.
Now frog was very high up.
How was he going to get down?
He drew in a big breath. It made him feel calm.
He looked down into the pond where he lives.
Then he threw his arms out and drove.
He flew through the air.
The stars are in the pond! He is so close!
Splash! He hits the water. Frog is in the stars!
He might not get to the stars in the sky….
but these stars will do just fine.
There are a lot of things in our world that have wheels.
They make machines work.
Different kinds of wheels are made for different jobs.
Some wheels, like the ones on her skateboard, are small.
Some wheels are very large, like the giant ferris wheel behind her.
Clocks have a lot of small wheels in them.
They allow the clock to keep the time.
They also move the hands so that we can read the time.
If you have a look at work sites and farms, you will see a lot of wheels.
There are wheels that allow this digger to move.
There are wheels inside the silo.
There are wheels all over the world.
They are in the house.
They are in forms of transport.
They help us get jobs done and move from spot to spot.
If we had no wheels, what would life be like?
Could we still get our work done and move from place to place, or would the world be in ruins?
There are a lot of things made in factories that we would have to go without.
Factories need wheels to turn out products like these ones.
We would have to make all of our food and clothing by hand.
We would have to use what we can grow, so we would have a different diet.
Animals would be the main way to move goods from town to town.
While it might sound fun, it can be hard to work with animals all of the time.
Sometimes they do not want to do what we say.
We would have to go back to the ways that things used to be.
It would be best to live by rivers so that we could use small boats for trade.
There are a lot of things we would have to do without, but not everything would be a trial.
There are some things that do not have wheels.
If we did not have machines, a lot of pollution would start to go away.
It would take a long time to break down, but the world would be in better health.
Which way would you like to live?
With wheels or without?
There are pros and cons to both ways of living.
Vines like to stretch out.
They can spread out along the ground or head up into the trees.
They are very good at hanging on.
Vines can climb up a trunk or down a branch.
They can go on quite a voyage!
Have you seen a tree with vines all over it?
Some vines have flowers and fruit.
The flowers grow first.
After they bloom and drop off, the fruit grows in those spots.
We can plant vines so that they cover houses and arches.
They can look great, but we must manage them.
Vines can wreck things as well.
Some trees get so covered that the vines take over.
They can do damage and even kill the tree.
They stop the tree from getting the food that it needs from the sun and the soil.
Some vines cling on with small curls.
The curls seek out a frame to twist around as they grow.
Once they hold tight, they cling on for life.
Vines can split, just like they have in the fork of this tree.
They can grow in both ways as they seek more room to take over.
Here are some vines on a farm.
They have spread out on the ground.
The farmer has cut a path so that they can pick the fruit that the vines grow.
Here are some vines that grow food under the ground.
The leaves catch the sun and send food down under the soil where there is no light.
These are savage vines that have grown in the wild.
Vines can take over a whole landscape!
We need to manage them if they are from a different part of the world as they can take over.
There are so many kinds of vines.
Next time you are out on the street, by a farm or in the wild, see what kinds of vines you can spot.
It is time to water the plants in the garden.
Gran has put a bottle on the end of the hose so that it can sprinkle all over the plants.
She loves the privacy of her garden.
I like to talk to the plants.
My mum thinks it is lunacy, but Gran says that they can hear what I say.
I tell them to grow up big and strong.
Gran has made a lift so that she can go up into the tree and pick the fruit.
I turn the wheel to make the lift go up.
We rig up a sheet as a slide.
Gran can just toss the coconuts onto the sheet slide and they roll down.
They get caught in the net at the end and fall into the basket.
We use this lever to help take off the husk.
The husk makes it hard to cut through the coconut and get to what is inside.
I am already tired from taking the husks off the coconuts.
Gran laughs.
There is still a lot of work to be done.
My family has always harvested coconuts.
It is our legacy.
Gran cracks open the coconuts with a knife.
She swings the knife down.
Her arm is like the lever on the machine.
I catch the water that comes out.
This machine has blades on the end of it.
As I turn, the blades spin.
It scrapes out the flesh of the coconut so that we can cook with it.
Now it is time for me to take a break.
Gran cooks the coconut on the stove.
The smell goes all through the house.
She tips the coconut into a large tin so that she can bake it.
The coconut will go hard and we will be able to cut it up into chunks.
We have made some coconut slice!
We have quite a lot.
We will eat some of it, but we put a lot of the slice in jars to give to people.
Now is the best part.
It is time to grab a bit of slice and eat!
It is nice and sweet.
Gran’s coconut slice is a delicacy in my family.
It is time to water. Turn on the tank!
Gran tries to give all of the plants a drink.
I tell the plants to grow up big and strong so that we can have some fruit.
Gran has made a lift.
I turn the wheel and she goes up into the tree.
She sends the fruit down on a slide.
The net grabs them.
This is how we take off the husk.
The husk is hard to cut through.
I am tired from that.
Gran spies me going off to play.
She says there is still a lot to do.
Gran wields a blade.
She cracks the coconuts open and I catch the water inside.
Now we scrape out the flesh. The flesh is hard.
We use a blade.
Now it is time for me to rest.
Gran cooks the coconut.
She can make a lot of things, like pies and bars.
She tips the coconut into a tin so that she can bake it into a bar.
The coconut is in chunks now. We put it into jars.
Now is the best part. It is time to eat!
We can see a human shape in the clouds!
It is a man in the sky. He waves at us.
Will he stick around or float off?
The clouds move.
We lay in the grass and watch them.
We want to see if the man in the clouds will come back.
Yes, he is back!
And he has brought a friend with him.
The lady and the man jump in the clouds and do a jig.
We do a jig too.
Now the men in the clouds are singing.
They look like they have strong lungs.
They raise up their arms as they belt out a tune.
There is a whole band in the clouds!
They can play different things. We like the drum.
We dance to the beat.
As the drum beats, a storm forms over us.
Rain starts to pelt down.
The beat of the drum turns into thunder.
We run into the house.
It is too wet to stay outside and watch the storm.
Our parents will want to know where we are.
We dance as we dry off.
We kick off our wet shoes and leave them by the door.
We dry off our hair.
We tell Mum and Dad about the cloud men in the sky.
We sing like they did.
Mum and Dad wish that they had seen the show!
We can be a band like the men in the sky.
Dad plays the drum well.
We play the pots and pans.
Watching the sky can make you feel puny, but it is cool to see how much the clouds change.
The man in the sky rests. We rest as well.
Rain! No frowns. We love days when it rains.
We can find spots to make a big splash.
We can play in the pond with the frogs.
We can lay out and let the rain fall on us as the water flows by.
If it starts to pelt, we can find a place to duck under.
Back at home. Dry clothes. I make a hot drink.
Then we start to read a book. I show them how.
We can sing in the rain as well. My dog howls.
We stay up late into the night and talk.
The sun is up!
I like the rain, but the sun is fun as well.
This rooster lives on a farm.
He spots a mouse to his side.
If he chases the mouse, he might be able to catch it.
The rooster leaps over a pen that has some hens in it.
It keeps its eye on the mouse so that it can catch it when it lands.
The rooster legs it. He runs at great speed.
The mouse pushes itself so that it can get somewhere safe from the rooster.
He misses the mouse!
The mouse has jumped into a haystack.
The rooster is not going to find it in all of that hay.
Oh no! You need to get out of there fast, rooster.
That dog does not look like it is happy about you being close by.
The dog legs it. He runs at great speed.
The rooster is running so fast that it loses some feathers from its tail.
The dog sails up into the air.
He feels like he is going to catch the rooster.
Is there anything that might get in the way?
The dog lands on the hen pen!
The hens are not pleased. They heard a crack.
The farmer will have to come and fix their roof.
The rooster sees that the dog has landed on the hen pen.
He legs it.
When the dog turns, he sees that the rooster is far off.
The rooster has made it back to his patch of hay.
He needs to take a rest. The mouse sneaks up.
The perfect time to steal some corn….
A rooster on a farm. He spots a mouse close by.
The rooster jumps over a pen with hens in it.
The rooster runs to get the mouse. He legs it.
He does not get the mouse. It jumps into the hay.
Oh boy! You need to get out of there, rooster!
The dog legs it. It runs to get the rooster.
The dog jumps up. He thinks that he will close in.
The hen pen! He lands in a bad spot.
The rooster sees how the dog lands. He legs it.
The rooster is safe. He joins a hen for a nap.
She wants to go and see her grandfather.
He lives on the other side of the woods.
She asks if she is old enough to go by herself.
Her parents say that she can go, but make the comment that she must not run.
If she runs, she might fall and get hurt when they are not there to help her.
She walks into the town and takes a right turn down the dirt road.
She has been to her grandad's house many times.
She hears a yap come from around the corner.
It makes her stop and turn.
She runs off down the street the wrong way.
Dogs frighten her.
There is a big dog that lives near her house.
He is so mean.
He tries to nip at her through the fence.
That is why she is scared of dogs.
She takes off when she hears the yap again.
She knows that her parents would be mad if they saw her, but she is so scared.
The dog that is near her house had big jaws.
She has seen it snap up bones when it is having a snack.
She must get away.
She hears the dog much closer now.
How did it get in front of her? She ran so fast.
Then it comes around the bend.
Oh! It is not a big dog. It is just a pup.
It is so small and cute.
She feels a bit silly now.
The pup just wants to play.
She says hi to the pup and asks if he wants to walk with her.
He does!
She is so happy that she is getting along with a dog.
She starts to run and skip by the forest.
The pup likes to chase her, but it is fun.
She slows down sometimes so that he can catch up.
She finds her grandfather outside of his house.
He has been picking fruit and vegetables.
They have a little picnic as she tells him about the pup.
He is proud that she got over her fear of dogs.
She wants to go to see her pop for a chat.
He lives in the woods.
Her mum and dad say that she can go, but she must not run.
She goes onto the town and turns into the dirt road.
She hears a yap. She stops. She turns. She runs.
She is scared of dogs.
There is a big dog that lives by her house.
He is mean.
She runs as fast as she can.
She thinks that the big dog might chase her.
The big dog can give a mean chomp.
She does not want it to bite.

She must choose what to do.
Oh! It is not a big dog. It is just a pup.
She thinks it is cute.

The elephant calf sees a butterfly.
The butterfly is like a magnet for her.
She wants to see it up close.
She loves butterflies and their pretty wings.

She does not see them.
They stay in the grass, out of sight.
They think it is better to keep hidden.
She can see some monkeys in a tree.
She wants to stop to have a look at them, but the butterfly floats on.
A whole swarm of butterflies!
She could spend all day here looking at their dots and stripes.
But her blue one goes on. It lands on….
a tiger’s nose! Oh no. She feels silly now.
Why did she run so far?
The elephant is just a calf.
She cannot fight a tiger. What is she going to do?
She calls for her mum, but her mum is too far away.
She has followed the butterfly deep into the jungle.
The little calf starts to run.
She tries to keep an eye on the tiger as she starts to run through the mud.
She launches through the swarm of butterflies.
They fly up into the sky.
She has no time to watch them.
There is an uproar as she passes the tree with the monkeys.
They can tell that the tiger is coming. They hide.
She passes by the snakes in their hiding spot.
She is so close to her mum and dad.
Is she going to make it?
Yes!
She finds her mum drinking water from the stream.
The tiger will not go for her with her mum about.
The calf says sorry for running off so far.
She has learned her lesson.
Her mum is just glad that she is safe.
She hugs her calf with her trunk.
A bug!
She will chase the bug so that she can have a good look.
She runs by some snakes. They keep out of sight.
She runs by some monkeys. They hang on tight.
She found a bunch of bugs!
She loves how their wings look.
Oh no! A tiger! That is not a good sight.

Lila is an artist.
She has a workshop where she paints on canvas.

It does not want to look like that.
Lila is set to start.

The house is quite dark.
What is that coming through the window?
She opens up the windows.
Light comes into the room.
She looks out at the town and sees how the light hits houses and trees.
She has a chat to yellow about why it is worried.
She tells yellow that if it is used in her art, it will be there for all time.
Yellow is so glad that it chose to be in the art.
It has brought out the details, and the whole tone is bright and fun.
Dan is up in a tall tree.
He wants to find a good leaf to snack on.
Is this one a good leaf?
Dan picks the leaf to give it a try.
Dan does not like it.
He sends it down to share with the fish.
Dan jumps to the next spot.
Will there be a good leaf here?

Does it want a snack as well?
Dan's mum grabs his leg. She is just in time!
Dan is back at it. He picks a leaf to try.
He wants to give the big fish some.

Some people live in houses that are tall.
They like to build their houses off the ground to keep them safe from random animal visits at night.
Some people live where they work.
This lady lives at the back of her shop.
She can cook and sell things from where she lives.
Some families like to live together.
Their children can play and the adults can share the chores.
They can all help each other.
Some people like to live close to town.
If they have a shop, it makes it easy for them to sell things to a lot of people in town.
Some people live in small apartments, or even just one room.
We see this in a big city.
The apartments are stacked on top of each other in a tall building.
Some people like to have a garage under their house.
He is a big name in bike fandom, so he must keep his bike in great shape.
Some people live in houseboats.
They seldom leave, but they can row a boat to shore if they need supplies.
They can get most of what they need from the sea.
There are so many different kinds of buildings that people live in.
Each style has its own kind of wisdom.
It works well for that part of the world or a way of living.
If you could choose any of these houses to live in, which would you pick?
A tall house? A houseboat?
There are so many spots to live.
Some of us live in a house that is tall and bends in the wind at all hours.
Some of us live at the back of a shop so where we work.
Some of us live in a big house on stilts.
We live with other people.
Some of us live in town.
It is loud, but there are more people to sell to in town.
Some of us just live in a room.
The rooms are stacked on top of each other.
Some of us like to have a spot where we can be proud of our skill with bikes.
Some people live out on a lake.
This house is like a boat!
There are so many spots to live in the world.
Which kind of house do you think works the best for you?
Dog and Cat used to be best friends.
They both slept out in the shed and spent all of their time playing.
They would sleep side by side as well.
Dog made Cat feel safe.
They lazed about under the biggest tree in the yard.
They had mishaps, but they always made up.
They would eat as friends as well.
Dog would wait to eat his food if Cat was not there.
They shared all parts of their lives.
One day, the people in the house saw Cat kill a rat.
They were so proud of her.
They wanted her to be closer to them.
Dog missed his pal.
Cat was in the house all of the time now.
She liked being around the people and sleeping in the house.
He felt like a misfit outside.
When Cat next went out into the yard, Dog showed her how angry he was.
He was upset that she did not care about him.
He was so mad at her for her misdeeds that he did not want to hear what she had to say.
He chased her out of the yard so that he could be alone again.
Cat did not see that Dog had misgivings about her being in the house.
She ran off so that she could give him some room.
She was also scared.
Cat made it back into the house.
She was so tired after having to run away from Dog.
She sat in her spot with her bowl of fresh water.
The two never patched things up.
They felt like they did not have enough in common to be friends.
But maybe one day they will try ….
Dog and Cat were pals. They had a lot of fun.
They had nap time side by side.
They did not make a fuss.
They ate at the same time and in the same spot.
One day, Cat got a rat. Dog did not.
Dog lost his pal.
Cat got to go in all of the time. It stung.
When Cat next went in the yard, Dog got mad at her.
Dog was so mad. He did a big bark.
It made her head ring.
He gave a snap of his fangs as she left the yard.
Cat had a rest. Her lungs swung from the run.
They have not made up.
They still do not like to talk.
But they may try one day ….
I am in the mood to do some art, but I cannot put my finger on what kind of art to do.
There are so many to choose from.
Sometimes when I want to do art, I have a picture of what I want to make in my head.
Not this time.
I just feel like making something cool.
My dad likes to paint the best.
We do some painting side by side.
I do not want to paint all day.
I just want to paint for a bit.
My mum likes to cut shapes out of paper.
She gives me a lesson.
You can make lots of different patterns by cutting paper.
When Gran comes to do some art, she brings different bits of flowers and leaves from the yard.
We press them onto the page.
Pop likes to do some writing when he feels like making art.
He writes the best stories.
They always make me feel like writing my own story.
I have done a lot of little bits of art, but I do not know what I want to do for my big piece of work.
My brother gives me a great idea.
I collect all of the art that I have done and write a story beneath it.
Now I have made a book to share with my family.
Here is a turtle!
A turtle has a hard shell and flippers.
The flippers can help it to move across the sand on a beach, but they are best for swimming.
A crab. It scuttles from side to side.
It walks along the seabed looking for things to eat.
It mostly eats plants, but it also hunts around for worms, shrimp and other snacks.
Fish come in a lot of colours, shapes and sizes.
These colours can help to break up their shape so that they can hide in the coral.
Clown fish, like the ones on the right, make a home in a sea anemone.
They do not get stung like a lot of fish do.
Anemone are in the same animal group as jellyfish and corals.
Here are some seahorses all in a row.
Females lay eggs in a pouch on the male.
The male looks after the eggs until they hatch.
Is that a red plant that is behind the rock?
It has suckers all over one side of each leaf.
They curl and twist in the current.
It is an octopus, not a plant!
An octopus has a beak in the middle where its legs meet.
It can crack open the shells of crabs and other animals.
The turtles are back! They can dive deep down.
Loggerhead turtles can hold their breath for ten hours before they pop up for air.
There is a clicking sound now.
What kind of animal has a grey tail like that that has a forked end?
Is it a shark?
No, it is dolphins!
They are very smart and live in groups.
Dolphins play with objects like rocks and shells just for fun!
As we come back to the top of the water, the turtle swims up for one last look.
Off it goes, diving back down into the sea.
A turtle! It can launch into the sea.
It can dive deep down. We can dive as well.
A crab off for a walk.
It has claws that can give a nip.
Fish come in all shapes and sizes.
Some are flat so that they can hide.
Fish can look like they have daubs of paint on them from a brush.
Seahorses all in a row.
They have fins on their heads and at the back.
Is that a red plant to the side?
It twists and swirls.
It is not a plant. It is an octopus!
It wants the crab as a snack.
The turtles are back!
They cause small wakes as they swim by.
What is that click?
A grey tail that ends in a fork shoots by.
Dolphins! They live in a pod.
Dolphins like to have a chat and play.
The turtle comes up for air as the sun sets.
One last look. Bye, turtle!
I feel like some art time, but I do not know which kind I want to do.
Some of the time I have a strong idea.
I peer off as I think. Not this time.
My dad likes to paint.
I do a bit of painting with him.
My mum likes to cut out shapes.
I do a bit of that as well.
My gran likes to do art with things from the yard.
Me too!
Pop likes writing the best.
He helps me learn how to be neat.
I still do not know what to do.
My brother feeds me an idea.
I take one more sheet.
I put all of my art in it and make a book!
This fish did not like the way that it was.
It was sick of being a fish.
It did not like looking like a fish nor acting like one.
The fish saw a rabbit.
He tried standing up like the rabbit was.
The rabbit said that he looked silly and did not want to be seen with him.
Next, he saw a bird.
The fish thought that he might try to fly with his fins, but he did not get far.
He did a small jump and then landed back down in the sea.
The bird swooped at him and said that they could not coexist in the sky.
The fish felt like a bore.
It could not stand on the land and walk about.
It could not fly in the sky like a bird.
All that it could do was swim.
Just when the fish was feeling at its lowest, he saw a cat.
The cat said that it was a big fan of fish.
The fish started to feel better.
The cat asked the fish to come closer, and he was happy to cooperate.
Oh no!
The cat meant that he likes to eat fish, not that he likes to spend time with them.
The fish dove back into the sea.
The fish stayed down at the bottom of the sea until the cat was gone.
At least being able to go into the sea could keep him safe.
The fish popped up one more time to see if he could learn a new way of life from a friend.
He found a frog sitting on a rock.
The frog was bored with being a frog.
He wanted to try something new for a while.
The fish understood.
He asked if the frog wanted to try diving down deep.
The frog wanted to, but did not know how to coordinate his limbs to swim that well.
The fish said that it would teach him.
They each had so much fun that they forgot about their worries.
They were no longer thinking about how bored they were with being a fish or a frog.
The fish swam with the frog as his copilot.
Now the fish and the frog help each other through thick and thin.
When one is having a bad day, the other knows just what to do.

He tells Owl that she has done a great job.
Owl is humble about her skills.

Somebody snuck up on these birds.
They are trying to catch them with nets!
The birds take.
flight so that they can get away.
Tim is not the kind of bird that can keep his mind on track.
He tries, but he finds himself doing things that he should not.
If he sees a cool bug, he must stop to check it out.
He has found a butterfly.
He might be here a while.
He has found a branch with a bunch of butterflies!
They flit to and fro as Tim has a look and sings a tune.
Oh no! Tim spent too long looking at the bugs.
His friends have moved on so that they could stay safe.
What will Tim do now?
He needs to be able to fly for a long time.
Tim has a long drink from a stream.
He does not want to have to stop on the way back to his friends.
He finds an earthworm as a snack.
It fills his belly so that he has the energy to fly for hours and find his flock.
Tim sets off into the sky.
Before long, he sees a dragonfly.
He wants to stop to take a good look, but he keeps on.
He goes right by a moth as well.
Tim is doing his best not to look at the ground so that he can stay on track.
But what is that he sees? A firefly!
The whole sky is full of fireflies!
Tim is so taken by the bugs that he does not see the men with nets.
Click! The light blinds him.
Tim froze when the light hit him.
Can he make it back up into the sky?
If he can just get above the nets.
Tim makes it up to where the nets cannot get him.
He flies all night.
He flies for so long that he sees the sun start to come up.
Tim is flying with his eyes shut so that he does not spot anything fun and want to stop.
But he flies right by his flock!
His flock was flying back to look for him.
Tim found them instead!
They are so proud that he kept on track and made it home.
What is this? Men want to get the birds with nets.
Tim does not heed what his pals tell him.
He wants to play.
Why, Tim? It is time to fly.
It is not time to look at a bug.

Tim gets up in the air.
He gets too high for the nets to catch him.
Tim has his eyes shut so that he will not stop.
But what did he miss?
His flock!
Tim will make sure that he does not get lost next time.
This is such a sad fish.
It does not like the way it is.
The fish stands up.
A rabbit says that he looks like a fool.
He tries to fly with his fins, but he does not get far.
So much for that. All he can do is swim.
He feels glum.
The fish sees a cat.
The cat says that he likes fish.
Oh no! The cat wants to catch him!
He dives back in the sea.
The fish stays in the sea until the cat is gone.
The fish pops up one more time. It finds a frog.
The frog does not want to jump.
He wants to learn how to swim.
They have a great day.
The frog can watch the fish and then move the same way.
The fish and the frog are there when the other needs a lift in their day.
Bee went out to get pollen from some flowers.
Bees do this all the time, but he got lost.
Now he cannot find his way back home.
It has ruined his day.
Elephant wants to help.
She scoops up Bee in her trunk and lifts him up into a tree.
There is a nest there. Is that where bees live?
No, birds live in a nest. This bird is mad.
It is going to dive and swoop at them until they are far off from its nest.
It must have eggs.
Is this Bee's home?
It looks a bit dark and scary to Elephant, but maybe bees like to live like that?
She has never seen a bee house before.
No, a cave is not a good spot for bees.
It makes a really great bat house though!
The bats stream out of the mouth of the cave.
Elephant keeps quiet. She can hear a buzz!
Over here! This must be a house for bees.
There are bees all over it!
Elephant lifts Bee up to the odd little shape that is stuck to a tree.
Yes, this is a hive. It is where bees live.
What a trial.
Elephant is so glad that she was able to help Bee out.
He buzzes about with his friends.
But now Elephant needs to get home, and she does not have the first clue of where to go!
She put too much focus on where Bee needed to go.
It's ok, Elephant.
Bee knows where his home is now.
He will be able to take you home.
That is what friends are for.
Aw no! Bee is lost. He cannot find his way home.
He makes a big buzz.
Elephant wants to help.
She puts Bee on her trunk and takes him up to a nest.
The bird is a bit raw about that.
She dives at them until they leave.
Is this Bee's home?
Elephant thinks it is a bit dark, but maybe bees like it?
No! This is a home for bats.
The bats all swarm out of the cave.
Is this hive his home? Elephant can see more bees.
It must be!
Yes, Bee is home! The other bees saw them coming.
They buzz as they greet him.
Elephant wants to go home, but which way is it?
Now she is lost.
It is ok. Bee will take her home.
This time she will make sure that she can get back.
I have a toy bike.
My dad can ride a big bike all by himself.
He is off to work.
I wish that I could ride a bike and go to work with him.
This is a scooter.
A scooter can go much faster than a bike.
There is a car on the road as well.
The scooter can catch up to the car.
I cannot wait until I am old enough to drive a car.
I will be able to go where I want to.
What is that next to me?
A bus with a green pigment.
Here I am driving the bus!
A bus can move a lot of people.
There are some roadworks happening.
I see a digger as I drive past.
I drive the digger off the road and across the field.
I want to get to where the land meets the sea.
A man on a jet ski comments on how he would like to drive a digger.
We swap!
The man has a ride on the digger while I have a go on the jet ski.
The jet ski is super fast.
I will use it to get to that boat.
I give a lady payment to borrow her boat.
I plan to drive the boat over to the big ship that is out at sea.
I steer the boat through the waves.
I got to the big ship! This is where Dad works.
It is just a figment of my imagination, but I made it all the way there!
I went on so many kinds of transport to get from home to my Dad’s work!
Which kind did you like the best?
This is a toy bike. My dad is on a big bike.
He can ride it.
What a fast bike! There is a car next to the bike.
Where am I? I am here in the car!
I strap in and grab the wheel.
Now I am driving the bus!
Work is being done on the road while I drive.
There I am in the digger.
I drive the digger to where the land meets the sea.
I swap my digger with the man on the jet ski.
I zoom on top of the waves.
The jet ski takes me to this boat.
I will take the boat over there.
I got to the big ship! I found Dad.
This is where he works.
What a lot of things I used to get from home to my Dad.
These kids live far out of town.
Their house and yard are always in ruins.
Their parents do not tell them to clean up.
Sometimes they clean up by themselves, but it always feels like a lot of work.
Then it just gets dirty again, so what is the point?
One day, a lady came by.
She said that she had a box of books that she was giving away.
The children did not have any books.
She sat down and opened them up.
They liked the way that the pictures looked, but they could not read the books.
So why would they need them?
They could not stop looking at the books.
The lady said that if they were quiet, she would be happy to teach them how to read.
She would also give the books to them if they looked after them.
The children started to tidy up.
They liked the place to look nice when the last came by once a week with new books to read with them.
But one day, the lady did not arrive.
They waited and waited until the sun went down, but there were no new books to read.
They mad up their minds.
They would have to go into the town and look for her.
Maybe she was mad at them?
They went to the town where there were neon lights and big buildings.
It felt alien to them.
After a long search, they found her scarf tied to a grate on a window.
They made their way up and knocked on the door.
The lady was sick.
She wanted to read books, but she did not have the energy.
All she could do was lay in bed and nap.
The children said that they would read to her like she had done for them so many times.
It was a riot!
They even made some new books themselves.
Before long, the lady was feeling like herself again.
She was out of bed and able to make the trip out for their reading lessons again.
These kids live out of town.
Their yard is full of goop and junk.
They try to clean, but it always seems to build up.
One day, a lady comes by.
She has a box of things to give them.
The box is full of books!
She sits on the ground and opens them up.
The kids come over.
They want to learn how to read.
She says that she has more books as well.
They will look out for when the lady comes next.
The lady does not come.
They want new things to read.
They go to the town to see if they can find her.
It takes a while to snoop about.
Then, they see her scarf tied to a grate.
They go in and find that the lady is sick.
How can they make her feel good again?
They get out some books and read to her.
They also make their own.
Soon the lady is well again.
The books helped them all.
We are a squad that plays football together.
We work very well as a team as we are all good at parts of play.
We trust each other to play well.
She can run fast.
It is her job to get the ball down to the end that we want it.
She bolts down the field as she keeps the ball in check.
He can swap which way he is going really fast!
With a small flick of his foot, he can spin the ball around and send it on.
I can kick the ball really hard. Whack!
I can send the ball into the net with ease.
That is my role on the team.
He can kick really high.
If we can’t run the ball down the field, that is what we do.
One of us must jump to get it at the other end.
She is the best at jumping to tap the ball with her head.
She never misses!
She has spent a lot of time on that skill.
We are warmed up and good to go!
We get to play at a high level now.
Our coach vouches for us.
The other team pull in on their bus.
It is time to start the game.
They play hard.
When our squad clashes with a team like this, we have to give it all we have got!
We can play hard too.
We each play our part in the team.
We play to our strengths.
Our squad thrashes other teams because we work well together.
We win!
When we each play our role in a team and trust our friends to do well at theirs, a team can be its best.
We are a squad! We work well as a team.
She can run fast. She gets the ball to the net.
He can do tricks with his feet and swap where he is going.
I can kick the ball hard. Whack!
I send it into the net.
He can kick so high!
And I can whack the ball with my head.
But she can jump up and hit the ball with her head the best.
Our squad is good to go! Time to get on the field.
They play hard. They are swift.
They do tricks with their feet.
They do not give us any slack, but we can read what our pals will do next.
We did it!
We all did our part and worked well as a team.
This monkey is called Dan.
He has a lot to learn about the world.
His mum keeps a close watch so that he does not get hurt.
Dan is in search of a good leaf.
He picks a few to try.
He wants to find a leaf that is green and has a good crunch to it.
The leaf that he tries has a bad taste.
Dan lets the leaf fall down into the stream under the tree that he is in.
He cartwheels to the next branch so that he can try a new part of the tree.
He has taken a big jump.
Will he land in the right spot?
Oh no!
Dan landed in the right spot, but the weight made the branch snap.
He is falling down into the stream.
There is a very big fish under the tree.
It sees that Dan is falling down.
Its jawbones are full of sharp teeth that are good for crunching.
Dan's mum grabs his leg and pulls him up.
That was close!
If she was not there, Dan would have been lunch for the big fish.
Dan is back up in the tree.
The big fish gave him a scare, but he cannot stop thinking about it.
He wants to fed the big fish.
Dan grabs a vine and slides down close to the water.
He throws some more leaves into the stream.
He hopes to see the big fish again.
Here it is!
Dan swings from side to side so that the big fish will miss as it jumps up out of the water to snap at him.
He can foresee where it will come out of the stream.
Dan’s mum is not a ran of the stunt that he just pulled.
There will be some backlash, but he thinks that it was great!
Now where is a good leaf….
We can see clouds in the sky.
We have found a man up there! He waves.
We rest in the grass as we stare up at the clouds.
We count them as they go by.
The men in the clouds do a jig!
She does a jig with them.
They start to sing.
They tilt their heads and put their arms up.
The men in the clouds are in a band!
They have a drum.
As he bangs the drum, a storm comes.
Rain falls down.
We run into the house. It is dry in there.
We have a bout of dancing as we dry off.
We sing for Mum and Dad, just like the cloud men did.
We play in a band and do a jig.
Then we rest, just like the cloud man does.
Time for sleep.
A big wave. They all ran.
Mel is lost. Oh no!
Can the girl help?
The girl is Jen.
Does Mel want a snack? No.
Mel wants her mum and dad.
Jen helps a lot. She mends arms and legs.
Mel did a bit as well. She must eat.
There is a lot to do. Mel can help kids.
She can stop the sad things in their minds for a bit.
She can get the kids to grin.
They can stop the sad things in Mel's mind as well.
The kids all rest. Jen tucks them in.
Mel's mum and dad find her! She can go.
Jen thanks Mel for her help.
There has been a big flood.

Mel found a safe spot up high.
The doctors are helping people.
Mel wants the doctor to help her.
She wants to find her mum and dad.
The doctor is called Jen.
Mel asks her to sing a song.
She sings with a smile.

Jen has to go back to help people.
Mel does not want her to go.
Mel helps as well.
She brings slings and kits to Jen.
She is a big help!
At the end of the shift, Mel wants a big meal.

Jen tucks them in.
Mel wakes up to her mum and dad!
Jen put out a call to find them.
Jen thanks Mel for all of her help.
She will tell her mum and dad all about it.
There has been a flood in Mel’s town.
Houses and trees were washed away.
People had to leave to stay safe. Mel got lost.
Mel found her way to a school at the top of a hill.
It was full of doctors.
They were helping people who had been hurt in the flood.
Mel tugs on a doctor’s shirt.
They turn around and see that she is not doing well.
She did not get hurt, but she has been through a lot.
The doctor sits with Mel.
She tells her that her name is Jen.
She says that they cannot call her parents right now, but will put Mel on a list so that they can find her.
Jen takes out a small pack of cookies.
She hopes that Mel will like them, but Mel is not in the mood to eat.
She is feeling bluish.
Jen has to go back to her shift.
There are more people that need her help.
Mel does not want to be by herself.
She is fluent in how people speak here.
She can help Jen.
Mel stays with Jen.
She does not know how to fix people, but she can bring things that Jen needs to heal them.
She talks to the people and gives them fluids.
Mel has been hard at work.
At the end of the shift, she has a big plate of food.
Jen is happy to see her eating.
Mel finds more kids that do not know where their parents are.
Here is a job that she can do.

They do some craft with Jen.
The people who work at the school gave them some art supplies.
They help each other out.
They turn out the lights and put on a torch so that they can tell a story.
They want to tell a story with shadows.
They make some friends for Mel’s toy by putting their hands into different shapes.
They make a dog, a cat and a rabbit.
When it is time for bed, they go to the bunks that have been set up for them.
The bunks have pillows and blankets.
Jen tucks them all in.
Mel wakes up to her mum and dad!
They found her name on the list that Jen put out.
They are so glad to have Mel back.
Jen tells Mel’s parents about all of the things that Mel helped her with.
They are so proud.
They say that they know that they are biased, but that they think Mel is the best girl in the world.
It makes Jen smile.
A big net.
The ray had to go.
A big storm. Oh no!
The ray is lost and hurt.
He went by this rock as a pup.
Can he find the way back?
Yes! The fish help.
They clean and mend him.
He helps the fish as well.
A boat with a big net. The ray has to think quick.
He goes deep down. He hides from the boat.
A big storm starts. Will the boat sink?
The ray gets lost and hurt.
These are the right kind of fish. He is on track.
He will be home in no time.
He swims by a big rock. The light blinks.
It makes him think of a time long gone.
He thinks he has seen this rock before.
He was a small pup.
He got home! These fish are his pals.
They live side by side. He does not eat them.
He eats krill.
The fish stick to his skin. They clean him.
They can help fix where he got hurt.
He helps the fish too.
They get scraps from what he eats and he keeps them safe.
This is a manta ray.
He has come across a big fishing boat.
He must take care not to get caught in its net while they catch fish.
He dives down deep so that he can be safe.
He stays there until he needs to eat.
Then he goes back up to check if the boat is gone.
There is a wild storm!
The boat rocks in the waves.
The manta ray gets thrown about in the sea.
He gets a scrape. He also gets lost.
Yes! A triumph.
And here are some of his fish friends.
Manta rays do not eat these fish as a part of their diet.
They eat small animals, like krill.
The manta ray must find a big group of fish.
The manta ray must get home.
It will be a trial, but he needs fish friends to heal him.
He saw this rock as a small pup.
The sea is quiet again. He is on the right track.
He will keep going and find more sights that help him to get home.
Here they are!
He can rest here and the fish will help to get him on the mend.
They stick to his skin and clean off the waste.
They start to clean the wound.
It will be much easier for the manta ray to heal when they are done.
These animals work as a team.
The manta ray’s role is to keep the fish safe.
They also get scraps of food while he is eating.
Living together makes life better for both kinds of animals.
Jim is off for a day of fun with his pals.
His pup runs off to greet them.
His friend, Len, said that he got a cool gift.
Len got a new toy boat from his dad.
It can float on the water. He is so proud of it.
Jim is jealous of his friend’s new toy.
Jim tells a lie.
He says that he has the best stuff in the world in his room.
Len and his friend call him out.
They can smell a lie.
It is true.
He does not have a lot of cool stuff in his toy boxes.
He will have to go on a search through the rest of the house.
Jim and his pup think about the different stuff around the house.
There are a lot of things that his family love.
He gets his grandpa’s best plant.
His grandpa is well known for his plants.
People come from all over town to buy them.

Jim’s dad has a lot of games, but this is his best one.
He plays with Pa and his friends a lot.
It must be a good one.
His sister, Jill, has a lot of books.
This one is all about foxes.
She has read it to him before.
It is the best story he has ever heard!
Last of all, Jim gets things from his mum’s room.
She has a lot of makeup.
She wears it when she wants to feel her best.
Jim’s pals do not think that this stuff is that cool.
They put it back where it all belongs so that Jim’s family will not get upset.
Oh no!
Jim’s mum is missing one of her bottles of perfume.
She wishes it was there.
They must have forgotten to put it back.
She asks them where it is.
They search all through Jim’s room, but they cannot find the bottle of perfume.
It is not in his bed. It is not in his cupboard.
Jim’s pup found the bottle!
It was under the chair. He snuffed it out.
He will get lots of scratches.
Jim’s pup is the best of all.
Jim and his pup are off to play with his pals.
His pal, Len, has a new gift. It is a ship.
Jim says that the ship is fine, but his toys are the best.
Jim told a lie.
He does not have a lot of good toys.
He must find the best stuff so that he can show his pals.
This is Pa’s best plant. He took it to a show.
This is Gran’s best wool.
She can make cool things with it.
This is Dad’s best game. He wins all the time.
This is Jill’s room. She has the best books.
I grab one.
Last of all, I get the best of Mum’s makeup.
Jim’s pals do not think his stuff is the best.
They put it back.
Oh no! Did they miss one of his mum’s things?
It is not in his bed. It is not by his lamp.
Where is it?
Jim’s pup finds it! The pup is the best.
Jim and his pup are off to have fun.
Len got a gift. It is the best!

He must find bits and bobs.
Pa’s says this pot is the best.
Gran does a lot with these.
Dad says this game is the best.
Jill has the best books.
Mum has a bag full of her best stuff.
Jim’s pals do not find it all fun.

Is it lost? His pals help Jim to find it.
The pup finds it! The pup is the best.
Oh no! Nets! Got to go, birds!
Tim wants to stop for fun.
No Tim! Got to go!
Tim stops. He spots a lot of bugs.
He does not spot his pals. Oh no!
He must drink.
He must eat.
Tim can go for a long fly now. Do not stop!
Do not stop for the big bug. Do not stop for the….
Star bugs! Oh no!
The nets! Got to go, Tim!
Fly fast. Do not stop!
His pals! Tim did not spot them.
He is back in his flock.
This is a cuckoo.
It is a big bird now.
But it has no call.
Is its call here? No.
Is its call there? No.
It will not find a mate with no call.
Life goes on by him.
The call will not come.
It gets cold.
It gets warm. Can he call in spring?
Yes! Spring is the time for a cuckoo to call.
Hair can curl.
Hair can be straight.
Tails can curl.
Tails can be straight.
Stairs that curl.
What else?
The hill curls up to the top.
I like straight lines.
I like lines with a curl.
A snack with a curl.
Or the straight one?
I like them both.
She has done a lot of work all year.
She goes to grab one of her nuts. They are gone!
Did the bird take it? No.
Did the bees? They buzz.
They get mad!
Did the fly?
The chimp?
The lizard?
None of them took the nuts.
They fell out of a hole!
She can fix it.
All is well.
One has fuzz. One does not.
They both have a lot of legs.
They are short.
That one is not.
They like the same snacks.
They both eat a lot.
They both must have a rest.
They make homes, but they are not the same.
One is spun from silk. One is hard.
As they come out, they must dry.
Then they can fly!
They are not up at the same time.
They both lay eggs.
Some parts are the same, but not all.
Dad is back from the shop.
I ask to draw the food.
It helps to draw things that are in front of me.
I can see spots that are lit up.
I do them in steps.
Can I draw my cat?
A cat is a bit hard to draw.
Oh! I snip and trim.
I made my cat out of the food that I drew!
Her red umbrella is just the best.
Is it lost? Yup.
It is not up.
It is not down.
She does not want an old can.
Her umbrella! Thanks mum.
His brother wants his stuff. ‘It is mine!’.
His mum sends him to bed.
He gets up. His brother is not home.
There is an elephant in the yard!
They find his brother.
An elephant runs at his brother.
He gets up in a tree.
‘Tell your pal not to hurt him!’.
They are too mad.
He went up to help. ‘Take my hand!’.
‘No! He is mine!’.
He wakes up. His mum smiles.
‘You do care for your brother.’.
It is the day of the big test.
Dragon will let out a burst of flame.
But it does not go well.
Dragon is sad. He had no flame at all.
A chili plant comes to life. It gives him a snack.
He is full of flame! The sky is lit up.
Dragon is so good he gets a job.
He keeps the boats safe.
One day, Jack heard a big clank close to the farm.
He went to check it out. It was an iron golem!
The golem was going in circles. It was lost.
Jack wanted to help it get to a town.
They like having a spot to defend.
Jack tried to push the golem. He could not.
It was like a tank.
Then he tried to steer it.
It would not go the way he wanted it to.
He threw small stones at it.
They made a clink, but it did not make the golem move on.
Jack sighed.
He wanted to help the golem, but he could not.
Then he got it.
He would have to be a hostile mob to get the golem to move.
Jack hit the golem on the foot.
It made the golem mad.
The golem was on his tail.
He ran to the next town.
The golem did not think of Jack once he had a town.
Jack does not need thanks.
Bones stays by Skel when they are not at home.
He is a good dog, but one day there was a storm.
Bones got a scare.
He ran off into the hills until he was just a dark shape.
Skel could not see Bones, but he still wanted to push on and find him.
Zom made him some food, but it did not help.
Skel was a mess.
Zom went out to find Bones while Skel had a short rest.
Bones had run into the woods.
He had found a wolf pack by a big bush.
The more time he spent with the wolves, the less like a dog he was.
He lost his collar and felt wild.
He shut out what made him a pet.
When Zom found him, Bones made a low growl.
He did not trust Zom.
But when Skel went with a collar, Bones came up to him.
He missed his pal as well.
Skel and Bones went home.
He was like his old self.
And the next time there was a storm, he did not run.
It is spring.
Chicks are out of their eggs.
That is a new dress.
We plant.
The sun is soft.
The cat is out! I grab him.
There are buds on the trees.
We make ink for Holi.
It is so much fun.
One day, Skel heard a strange thump out in the yard.
He found that they had a llama drama.
They left some bread and steak out. Was it that?
Skel told the llamas to beat it.
He did not want them to stomp on Zom’s crops.
The llama drama got worse.
It was not the bread and steak. It was the grass.
The grass on the farm is sweet.
They like it there.
Zom makes a pen for some of them.
But they still had to sort out what to do with the rest.
Zom put leads on the llamas. They went with him.
Skel wasn’t sure that was going to solve their llama drama.
The next day, there were scores of them.
They loved the grass on their farm.
Skel tried to scare them off.
There was a great storm of spit sent his way.
Zom found Skel in a state. He was weak.
They went into the house.
Things felt bleak, but Skel would try to fix the drama in a new way.
The villagers are having an art show.
Skel wants to put in some art.
He looks for a muse.
The villagers know all of the tricks in the book.
A squid! Most squid are black.
This one looks like it has gold on it.
A golden apple is in the lake.
The squid takes a big bite.
The squid drops an ink sac.
The ink is gold as well!
Skel has found his muse!
He grabs snacks to put in the lake.
Each time he puts in a snack, the squid shifts in hue and drops an ink sac.
Skel picks them all up.
He sets up his things by the lake and starts to paint.
The villagers just use black paint.
This will make a splash!
Skel makes a lot of art.
They all look good, but the squid is the best!
Skel lines his art up with the rest.
What will the villagers think?
The villagers do not sook.
They all want to ask how they can paint like Skel.
Oh no! Zom and Skel left their door open.
They wake up to a hut full of monsters!
